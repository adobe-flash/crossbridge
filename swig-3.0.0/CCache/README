This is a re-implementation of "compilercache" in C

The original compilercache scripts were by Erik Thiele
(erikyyy@erikyyy.de) and I would like to thank him for an excellent
piece of work. See http://www.erikyyy.de/compilercache/ for the
original shell scripts.

I wrote ccache because I wanted to get a bit more speed out of a
compiler cache and I wanted to remove some of the limitations of the
shell-script version.

Please see the manual page and documentation at
http://ccache.samba.org/

INSTALLATION
------------

Please run:

  ./configure
  make
  make install

then read the ccache manual page
