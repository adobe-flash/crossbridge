ccache (2.4-8) unstable; urgency=high

  zlib compression is now enabled by default in order to increase the amount
  of object files that can fit in the cache.

  The impact on performance is supposed to be almost negligible
  (see http://www.gustaebel.de/lars/ccache/). If you do want to disable
  it however, simply export the CCACHE_NOCOMPRESS environment variable.

  Note that a zlib-enabled ccache will still read your existing
  uncompressed cache.  If you want to compress/uncompress your cache,
  see the manage-cache.sh script under /usr/share/doc/ccache/examples/.

ccache (2.4-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * This release changes the hash input slighly, so you will probably find 
    that you will not get any hits against your existing cache when you 
    upgrade.
