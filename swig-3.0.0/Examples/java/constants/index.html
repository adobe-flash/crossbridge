<H2>Wrapping C Constants</H2>

<p>
When SWIG encounters C preprocessor macros and C declarations that look like constants,
it creates Java constant with an identical value.  Click <a href="example.i">here</a>
to see a SWIG interface with some constant declarations in it.


<h2>Accessing Constants from Java</h2>
Click <a href="../../../Doc/Manual/Java.html#constants">here</a> for the section on constants in the SWIG and Java documentation.
<p>

Click <a href="runme.java">here</a> to see a Java program that prints out the values
of the constants contained in the above file.</p>
<h2>Key points</h2>
<ul>
<li>The values of preprocessor macros are converted into Java constants.
<li>Types are inferred by syntax (e.g., "3" is an integer and "3.5" is a float).
<li>Character constants such as 'x' are converted into Java strings.
<li>C string literals such as "Hello World" are converted into Java strings.
<li>Macros that are not fully defined are simply ignored.  For example:
<blockquote>
<pre>
#define EXTERN extern
</pre>
</blockquote>
is ignored because SWIG has no idea what type of variable this would be.

<p>
<li>Expressions are allowed provided that all of their components are defined. Otherwise, the constant is ignored.

<li>Certain C declarations involving 'const' are also turned into Java constants. 
<li>The constants that appear in a SWIG interface file do not have to appear in any sort
of matching C source file since the creation of a constant does not require linkage
to a stored value (i.e., a value held in a C global variable or memory location).
</ul>
