SWIG Source directory

 Source/DOH          -  A core set of basic datatypes including
                        strings, lists, hashes, and files.  Used
                        extensively by the rest of SWIG.

 Source/Swig         -  Swig core. Type-system, utility functions.

 Source/Preprocessor -  SWIG C Preprocessor

 Source/CParse       -  SWIG C Parser (still messy)

 Source/Modules      -  Language modules.

 Source/Include      -  Include files.

Historic directories which may be in CVS, but have been removed:

 Source/Modules1.1   -  Old SWIG-1.1 modules. Empty.

 Source/LParse       -  Experimental parser.  Officially dead
                        as CParse is more capable.

 Source/SWIG1.1      -  Old SWIG1.1 core. Completely empty now.
