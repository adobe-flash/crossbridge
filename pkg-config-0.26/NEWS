pkg-config 0.26
===

 - Build system fixes
 - More tests
 - pkg.m4 fixups which makes autoconf 2.66 happier.
 - Drop support for legacy -config scripts.  Those should already be
   gone and cause problems in cross-compilation environments.
 - Drop embedded glib
 - Fix up pkg.m4 to handle the case of --exists working and --cflags
   or --libs failing.
 - Various documentation updates
 - Allow $() through without escaping it.
 - Add --with-system-include-path instead of hard-coding
   /usr/include.

pkg-config 0.25
===

 - 0.24 included a too strict whitespace/shell metacharacter filter
   leading to some legal characters like = and : being escaped in the
   output.  This has been fixed.
 - when building with newer and external libpopt, it would be confused
   over being asked to split an empty string, leading to errors with
   packages that included empty fields in their .pc files.
 - Make the COPYING file explicitly GPLv2.  The COPYING file in 0.24
   was inadvertently GPLv3 rather than the correct GPLv2.
 - Minor changes to documentation

pkg-config 0.24
===
 - Fix up bug in PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT handling which mangled non-I and
   non-L arguments
 - Put /usr/lib/pkgconfig and /usr/share/pkgconfig into the default
   search path when no prefix is passed to configure.
 - Portability fixes for Windows and NetBSD
 - Various man page updates
 - Add logging support to log how pkg-config is being called.
 - Skip Requires.private unless we need them for Cflags
 - Add a variable, pc_path to the compiled-in pkg-config package that
   you can query for the compiled-in PKG_CONFIG_PC_PATH.
 - Various updates to pkg.m4.
 - Update rpmvercmp with bugfixes from upstream.
 - Add introductory guide to pkg-config, thanks to Dan Nicholson for
   the patch.
 - Add listing of variables in a package
 - Make it possible to use external popt.
 - Add --print-provides and --print-requires(-private) options
 - Add support for paths containing whitespace and shell metacharacters

pkg-config 0.23
===
 - Add support for setting sysroot through PKG_CONFIG_SYSROOT_DIR in
   the environment.
 - Update included glib to 1.2.10.
 - Other minor fixes, including a segfault.

pkg-config 0.22
===
 - Make Requires.private a whole lot more useful by traversing the
   whole tree, not just the top-level, for Cflags.
 - Add support for using the system glib.
 - Update URL to pkg-config website
 - Fix some win32 problems.
 - Other minor fixes.

pkg-config 0.21
===
 - Fix some cosmetic output from pkg.m4
 - Fix build problems with !gcc due to always passing -Wall
 - Documentation fixes
 - We now always add the Cflags from packages we depend on, whether
   they are public or private dependencies.  The discussion surrouding
   this change can be found in http://bugs.debian.org/340904 .
 - Add internal pkg-config package which can be queried for version
   number and other information.

pkg-config 0.20
===
 - Fix test suite to work on Solaris.  Yay non-POSIX /bin/sh :-(
 - Fix segfault on --help with gcc4.  Fix segfault on bigendian arches
   in some cases.
 - Win32 fixes
 - Add --short-errors, now used by pkg.m4 if available.  This gives a
   better error message if some libraries can't be found.

pkg-config 0.19
===
 - Fix a segfault
 - Fix default search path
 - Fix cosmetic bug in pkg.m4 where AC_MSG_RESULT wasn't called in
   some cases.

pkg-config 0.18.1
===
 - Fix up pkg.m4 to not end up with pkg_failed=untried always.

pkg-config 0.18
===
 - The inter-library dependencies check was too tight and caused
 problems if one used the --no-undefined flag to libtool on Solaris
 (since it there expands to -Wl,-z,defs which disallows undefined
 symbols).  Add a new name to .pc files: Libs.private which will not
 be listed in the output of --libs unless --static is also given.

 Private libraries are libraries which are needed in the case of
 static linking or on platforms not supporting inter-library
 dependencies.  They are not supposed to be used for libraries which
 are exposed through the library in question.  An example of an
 exposed library is GTK+ exposing Glib.  A common example of a private
 library is libm.

 Generally, if include another library's headers in your own, it's a
 public dependency and not a private one.

 Thanks a lot to James Henstridge for both the bug and the following
 discussion.

pkg-config 0.17.2
===
 - Don't go into an infinite loop allocating more and more memory when
   the same name is specified twice on the command line and we're in
   "direct dependencies only"-mode.

pkg-config 0.17.1
===
 - Now actually sets CFLAGS and LIBS instead of trying to set those in
   a subshell.  (Only affects if you've autoreconfiscated with 0.17)
 - Fix detection of inter-library dependencies.

pkg-config 0.17
===

 - Evaluate second argument to PKG_CHECK_MODULES again
 - Portability fixes (MacOS, BeOS, Cygwin)
 - Handle inter-library dependencies and assume those are in place if
   the platform supports them.  Disable with --enable-indirect-deps.
 - Add initial test framework
 - Build fixes (make distcheck now works)

pkg-config 0.16
===

 - Use a search path, rather than a single default directory.
 - Fix a bunch of bugs in glib by backporting
 - More man page fixes
 - Lots of small fixes and cleanups over the place.
 - pkg-config now grabs _PKG_* and PKG_*, so don't use variables
   starting with that in any configure scripts.

pkg-config 0.15
===

 - add PKG_CONFIG_LIBDIR for cross-compiling (David Schleef)
 - add --libs-only-other/--cflags-only-other (Zack Rusin)
 - apply man page fixes (Pter Breitenlohner)
 - C portability fix (David Robins)
 - fix to win32 build (Tor Lillqvist)
