# CrossBridge

CrossBridge is the open-source version of Adobe FlasCC (formerly the [Alchemy] (http://labs.adobe.com/technologies/alchemy/) project). 
It provides a complete C/C++ development environment for targeting the Adobe Flash Runtime.  

Features:

* [LLVM-GCC 4.2](http://llvm.org) compiler with Flash backend
* [GDB](http://www.sourceware.org/gdb) debugger that debugs your code while running in the Flash Player
* [SWIG](http://www.swig.org) backend that auto-generates inter-operability code, allowing you to build Flash libraries (SWCs) that wrap C/C++ libs
* Multi-threading based on [POSIX Threads](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/POSIX_Threads)
