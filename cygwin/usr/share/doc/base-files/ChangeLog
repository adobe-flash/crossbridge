Cygwin base system miscellaneous files
--------------------------------------
TODO:
-----
    * Write a cygport file.
    * Should future versions relay in /etc/mkshrc to set PS1 properly for mksh
      if mksh supports sourcing /etc/mkshrc for interactive-login sessions?
    * Ask zsh mantainer to put /etc/zprofile and /etc/zshrc in place during
      installation.
    * Should users with GID 544/0 have /usr/bin/sbin in their paths?

Change Log
----------
4.1-1

      and doesn't play well with mintty. Changed to a user-defined setting in
      /etc/profile/lang.* Reported by Peter Rosin and Andy Koppe. See
      cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-02/msg00448.html
4.0-9

      In profile.d/* scripts, calls to "locale" and "tzset"
      must use absolute paths - Harry G. McGavran, Jr.

      cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2012-01/msg00201.html
    * Added two files under /etc/profile.d/ that use tzset, which
      uses the geographical location setting of the user to find the right
      mapping, rather than the locale setting. Only on Windows 2000 which
      doesn't know about the user's geographical location, or if fetching
      the geographical location fails, it falls back to the user's locale.
