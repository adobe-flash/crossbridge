Coreutils 8.15-1
------------------------------------------
GNU coreutils provides a collection of commonly used utilities essential
to a standard POSIX environment.  It comprises the former textutils,
sh-utils, and fileutils packages.

The cygwin port has several patches.  Because Windows insists on
naming executables with a `.exe' suffix, several of the utilities have
been patched to automatically handle this suffix when given the
traditional Unix name with no suffix (`cp', `install', `ln', and
`mv').  Other issues arise because of the difference between text and
binary mounts; some utilities default to binary mode and others
attempt to respect the underlying mount point, depending on the most
common usage pattern of the utility.  `df' attempts to recognize
Cygwin's mount information, but cannot determine the underlying file
systems (FAT, NTFS, NFS, etc.).  Also, `ls' and `stat' have a
cygwin-specific option, --append-exe, to add .exe to a filename if
needed.  If you encounter difficulties in these areas, contact the
cygwin mailing list.

This release depends on features that did not exist prior to
cygwin-1.7.10.  There are still corner cases of POSIX compliance that
are impossible without more support from future cygwin versions, such
as proper treatment of directory ctime or atomicity of some low-level
functions, or outright impossible, such as hard links on a FAT drive.
`su' works only if the current user has appropriate privileges (by
default, only SYSTEM qualifies; even Administrators don't have the
necessary privileges).  Cygwin provides its own `kill' that
understands Windows pid's, so the coreutils version is renamed
`gkill'.  There are several bugs in the testsuite, so don't be alarmed
at failures and use `make -k check' to make it to the end.

Build instructions:
  unpack coreutils-8.15-1-src.tar.bz2
    if you use setup to install this src package, it will be
    unpacked under /usr/src automatically
  cd /usr/src
  cygport coreutils-8.15-1 all

This will create:
  /usr/src/coreutils-8.15-1.tar.bz2
  /usr/src/coreutils-8.15-1-src.tar.bz2

Or use 'cygport coreutils-8.15-1 prep' to get a patched source directory

To find out the files included in the binary distribution, you can use
"cygcheck -l coreutils", or browse the listing for the appropriate
version at <http://cygwin.com/packages/>.

longer necessary.  For example, date(1), nice(1), and od(1) now work
out of the box.  Also, add hack to pwd(1) to avoid floppy seeks on
/cygdrive.

----------  coreutils-5.3.0-2 -- 2005-02-01 ---------
Repackage to remove uptime(1) since it conflicts with procps.  Work
around limitation of cygwin readdir that was affecting pwd(1).

New upstream release, see /usr/share/doc/coreutils*/NEWS for upstream
changes.  First cygwin release by Eric Blake.  Coreutils kill(1) is
provided as gkill(1), df(1) recognizes local drives from the cygwin
mount table.

----------  coreutils-5.2.1-5 -- 2005-01-03 ---------
More cygwin patches: install(1) hands .exe suffix to strip(1), since
strip does not append one itself.

----------  coreutils-5.2.1-4 -- 2004-12-27 ---------
More cygwin patches: cat(1) binary logic improved, du(1) block size
corrected, od(1) always uses binary mode.

----------  coreutils-5.2.1-3 -- 2004-12-27 ---------
More cygwin patches: cp(1) always uses binary mode, ln(1) and mv(1)
fixed in some .exe corner cases.

----------  coreutils-5.2.1-2 -- 2004-12-23 ---------
Initial cygwin release by Corinna Vinschen, replaces fileutils,
sh-utils, and textutils.  Cygwin port omits kill(1), replaces su(1)
with a script that gives a helpful error message, and cp(1), mv(1),
install(1), and ln(1) contain patches to handle implicit .exe better.

implicit .exe suffix, testsuite failures) to the Cygwin mailing list
