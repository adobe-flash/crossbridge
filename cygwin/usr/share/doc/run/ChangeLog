2011-01-25  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Release 1.1.13
	* configure.ac: Bump version.
	* TODO: Update documentation.

2011-01-25  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	* src/run.h: Remove ancient workarounds for cygwin
	B19 and B20 (CYGWIN_CONV_* macros for cygwin[32]_conv_*
	functions).
	* src/run.c (xemacs_special): Remove ancient workarounds
	for cygwin B19 and B20: don't use CYGWIN_CONV_* macros
	but instead call cygwin_conv_* functions directly. If
	replacement is available, avoid obsolete cygwin_conv_*
	functions.
	(process_execname): Ditto.
	(get_exec_name_and_path): Ditto.
	(addPathCygwin): Ditto.
	(fileExists): Ditto.
	* NEWS: Update documentation.

2011-01-25  Jonathan Kamens  <jik@kamens.us>

	* src/run.c (process_execname): Validate symlink
	lookup to avoid segfault.

2009-12-01  Corinna Vinschen  <corinna@vinschen.de>

	* src/run.c (configure_startupinfo): Ensure stdout
	and stderr are distinct. Open with corrent flags.

2009-08-18  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Release 1.1.12
	* configure.ac: Bump version.
	* src/resource.rc.in: Fix typo in copyright date. Run
	was first rewritten and released as an entity separate
	from xemacs' runemacs in 1998, not 1988.

2009-08-18  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Only create (and hide) a console if absolutely necessary.
	* src/run.h: Test $target.exe before $target. Pass $target
	name, as well as cmdline, to start_child.  Pass argc by
	reference to build_cmdline.
	* src/run.c (target_is_gui): New function.
	(have_console): New function:
	(build_cmdline): Modify *argc and argv in-place, to remove
	-wait if present, before constructing cmdline.
	(WinMain): Ripple from run.h changes. If $target is GUI, then
	do not call start_child nor worry about the console; instead,
	launch $target directly using: if not -wait, a lobotomized call
	to CreateProcess; if -wait, then _spawn with the modified argv.
	(setup_invisible_console): Do nothing if already have console.
	(configure_startupinfo): If we have a console, and have not
	requested pipes, then ensure that stdio of child will be the
	non-redirected CONOUT$ and CONIN$ of that console (avoids 100%
	CPU issue).
	(start_child): Change bHaveInvisConsole to bHaveConsole, and
	initialize it using explicit test via have_console(). Refactor
	W7 workaround. Only set bForceUsingPipes if DEBUG_FORCE_PIPES.
	* NEWS: Update.
	* README: UPdate.

2009-08-16  Corinna Vinschen <corinna@vinschen.de>

	* src/resource.rc.in: Fix filename case to accommodate case sensitive
	filesystems.

2009-08-15  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	* build-aux/.cvsignore: Update.

2009-08-14  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	More 100% CPU fixes
	* src/run.c (configure_startupinfo): Accept new parameter
	bForceUsingPipes, to force setting up new handles for child
	stdio.
	(start_child): Set bForceUsingPipes TRUE for WinXP and above.
	* NEWS: Update documentation.

2009-08-14  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Fix performance problems wrt urxvt-X (for < Windows 7)
	* src/run.c: Only use Windows 7 workaround ON Windows 7.
	* README: Document limitations on Windows 7.
	* TODO: Add Windows 7 entry.
	* AUTHORS: Recognize Corinna Vinschen's current and
	previous contributions to invisiconsole support.
	* NEWS: Update documentation.

2009-08-10  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Release version 1.1.11.

2009-08-10  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>
	    Corinna Vinschen  <corinna@vinschen.de>

	Windows 7: Enable proper invisiconsole operation.
	* TODO: New file.
	* Makefile.am: Add TODO. Fixup distribution perms; ensure
	autoreconf works on distributed tarball.
	* configure.ac: Detect cygwin-1.7; use a config.h. Use
	ustar format for distributed tarball, for empty m4/ directory.
	Check for setenv function.
	* src/resource.rc.in: Include config.h.
	* src/run.h: Declare new function run_setenv.
	* src/run.c: Include config.h.
	(start_child): On cygwin-1.7, expect cygwin's startup code to
	automatically create an invisible console for us (works around
	bug in Windows 7, but employed regardless of OS version). On
	cygwin-1.5 and mingw, use a different workaround (but employ it
	on WinXP and above, not just Windows 7). (Corinna Vinschen).
	(run_setenv): New function.
	(addPath): Use run_setenv (restores MinGW support).

2009-08-10  Charles Wilson  <cygwin@cwilson.fastmail.fm>

	Updated build machinery and documentation.
	* build-aux: New directory.
	* m4: New directory.

	* run.c: Pipe stdin, stdout and stderr to child process

2005-04-20  Alexander Gottwald  <ago at freedesktop dot org>

	Released as x-startup-scripts-1.0.10

	NOTE: as run was released as a component of x-startup-scripts,
	the standalone directory included a Makefile.am but no
	configure.ac, and as such is unbuildable.  This repository
	instead introduces new modifications to Makefile.cygwin
	to allow this version to compile for historical purposes.
	Furthermore, various icons that were not part of ago's
	release are still present, because they were added right
	back in run-1.1.5...

	Finally, ALL of these changes, from this point down to 
	the release of version 1.1.4 below, are one single checkin
	in the repository, because we no longer have access to
	the development repository of the time.

2009-08-15  Charles Wilson

	Artificial changes to allow building this old version
	with existing (non-subproject) build infrastructure.
	Of course, you'd need a contemporaneous gcc, because
	modern gcc's provide a crt0.o startup object that includes
	a conflicting symbol...so you STILL can't actually build
	this version.

	* Makefile.cygwin: Modify build procedure.
	* Makefile.vc: Removed.

2004-10-25  Alexander Gottwald  <ago at freedesktop dot org>

	* run.c: Fixing buffer overflow reported by Kirby
	Kuehl <kkuehl at cisco dot com>

2004-10-06  Alexander Gottwald  <ago at freedesktop dot org>

	* run.c: Added ability to expand PATH variable with
	-p <dir> parameter 

2004-03-11    <harold@codeweavers.com>

	* X.ico: Update X.ico in run.exe with Jehan Bing's latest.
	* X-boxed.ico,resource.rc: Add Benjamin Riefenstahl's boxed X
	icon to run.exe.

2004-03-10    <harold@codeweavers.com>

	* run.rc: Renamed to...
	* resource.rc: this. Change the XEmacs icon to the XWin icon.
	Eliminate other icons.

Version 1.1.4 - 19-Dec-98
--------------------------
	- No code changes
	- CYGWIN: tested under 20.1, new binary included in package
	- CYGWIN: tested "rungnuclient" functionality under Cygwin B20.1
	- CYGWIN: tested "rungnuclient" functionality under Cygwin B19.x
	    Thanks to Raymond Toy
	- documentation changes

Version 1.1.3 -  8-Dec-98
--------------------------
	- No code changes
	- added icons
	- NATIVE: added version info properties page

Version 1.1.2 -  5-Dec-98 (NOT RELEASED)
--------------------------
	- BOTH: more code cleanup
	- CYGWIN: removed some unnecessary calls to cygwin_conv functions
	  When cygwin_conv_to_posix_path() and _posix_path_list() functions
	  are called on paths/pathlists that are already in posix format
	  they return garbage in B19. So don't call them when you don't
	  have to.
	- CYGWIN: added #defines to enable building under both B19 and 
	  B20 without modifying the source code. UNTESTED under B20.

Version 1.1.1 - 30-Nov-98 (NOT RELEASED)
--------------------------
	- cleaned up code a little bit (and you thought the code
	  was messy NOW!)
	- fixed all known bugs

Version 1.1.0 - 18-Nov-98 (NOT RELEASED)
--------------------------
	- added ability to search PATH for the target
	- added ability to specify explicit path information for
	  the target, which removed requirement that run.exe and 
	  the target be in the same directory
	- added "simple" mode of operation, where run.exe is
	  renamed to runXXXXXX.exe, to run target XXXXXX
	- SHOWSTOPPER: cygwin version gets confused if '\\' character
	  appears in the argument list 

Version 1.0.0 - 29-Sept-98
--------------------------
	initial release
