AUTHORS of findutils

I do not know the name of the original author of the findutils
package, but the authors of all the major components are known.  Eric
B. Decker contributed GNU find and Michael Rendell contributed xargs.
James A. Woods contributed locate.

Here are the names of some authors culled from ChangeLog and
miscellaneous other files.  The main criterion for whether your name
ends up in this file or in THANKS is that the people with entries here
donated code or documentation which was significant enough to require
a copyright assignment.

The locate program and its helper programs are derived (heavily
modified) from James Woods' public domain fast-find code, which is
also distributed with the 4.3BSD find.

The current maintainer of the findutils package is James Youngman.
Questions about findutils should be addressed to the mailing list,
<bug-findutils@gnu.org> which, contrary to the impression given by its
name, is used for general discussion of the findutils package.
