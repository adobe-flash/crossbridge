2010-11-07  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Version 1.25
	* configure.ac: Version 1.25
	* NEWS: Describe the changes.

2010-11-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Run alternative decompression programs if the principal one is
	not available.
	Some compression programs are able to handle various compression
	formats
	(e.g. `gzip' can decompress files created by `compress', `xz'
	is able
	to handle lzma, etc.)  Tar tries to use such programs for
	decompression
	if the principal decompressor cannot be started.

	* src/buffer.c (compress_type): Swap ct_none and ct_tar.
	(archive_compression_type): New static variable.
	(zip_magic): Remove program and option fields.
	(zip_program): New structure and static.
	(compress_program): Remove macro.
	(find_zip_program): New static function.
	(first_decompress_program,next_decompress_program): New functions.
	(open_compressed_archive): Set archive_compression_type instead of
	use_compress_program_option.
	* src/common.h (first_decompress_program)
	(next_decompress_program): New functions.
	(WARN_DECOMPRESS_PROGRAM): New flag.
	(WARN_VERBOSE_WARNINGS): Include WARN_DECOMPRESS_PROGRAM.
	* src/warning.c (warning_args): Add "decompress-program".
	(warning_types): Add WARN_DECOMPRESS_PROGRAM.
	* src/system.c (run_decompress_program): New function.
	(sys_child_open_for_uncompress): Use run_decompress_program
	instead of calling execlp directly.

2010-11-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tests: fix some issues with signals, timestamps, "test" typo
	* tests/extrac17.at: Add --warning=no-timestamp, to avoid
	bogus warning due to NFS clock skew.
	* tests/remfiles01.at: Discard diagnostics that some shells
	generate about broken pipes.
	* tests/sigpipe.at: Likewise.
	* tests/remfiles01.at: Fix typo: "test $EC" was written where
	"test $EC -ne 0" was intended.

2010-11-01  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Fix extraction of device nodes.
	* src/extract.c (extract_node): Do not mask out node type.
	The bug was introduced in commit ea964cce.

2010-10-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: don't cross struct member boundaries with OLDGNU_MAGIC
	* src/create.c (write_gnu_long_link, start_header): Access
	header->buffer + offsetof (struct posix_header, magic), instead of
	header->header.magic, when reading or writing the OLDGNU_MAGIC
	pattern.  The code violates the C standard without this change,
	and GCC warns about this if fortify checking is enabled.  It's not
	a bug on traditional (i.e., non-debugging) platforms, but it does
	violate the C standard so it should be fixed.  Problem originally
	reported by John Emil Karlson in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-04/msg00023.html>.
	* src/list.c (decode_header): Likewise.

	tests: port to sh variants that squirrel away file descriptors
	OpenBSD /bin/sh, and some other sh variants, squirrel away file
	descriptors before closing them.  For example, for "cat 3<&-" they
	first dup file descriptor 3 to a fd that is 10 or greater, then
	close 3 (because if "cat" had been a builtin command like ":" then
	they would have wanted to avoid the fork and restore the fd after
	":" finished); and they treat ordinary (forking) commands the same
	as builtin commands.  This approach fails after "ulimit -n 10".
	Work around this deficiency by closing the file descriptors before
	invoking ulimit.  Problem reported by Christian Weisgerber in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-10/msg00041.html>;
	solution suggested by Jilles Tjoelker in
	<http://article.gmane.org/gmane.comp.shells.dash/415>.

	* tests/extrac11.at (scarce file descriptors): Close file
	descriptors before invoking ulimit -n.

2010-10-27  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Transform file names when updating and appendig to archives.
	This complements 28e91b48.

	* src/common.h (transform_stat_info): New prototype.
	* src/list.c (transform_stat_info): Remove static qualifier.
	* src/update.c (update_archive): Call transform_stat_info.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add append03.at
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include append03.at

2010-10-27  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tests: port to Solaris diff
	* tests/extrac13.at: Don't assume that "diff -c" outputs nothing
	when there are no differences.	This is not true on Solaris,
	where it outputs "No differences encounted".

	tar: fix -x --overwrite bug (no --dereference, ! O_NOFOLLOW)
	This bug was discovered on Solaris 8.  On older hosts lacking
	O_NOFOLLOW, tar -x --overwrite (without --dereference) follows
	symbolic links, causing the "extract over symlinks" test to fail.

	* src/extract.c (open_output_file): If O_NOFOLLOW is needed but
	does not work, check for a symlink separately.

	tar: don't use "((" in shell scripts
	* tests/extrac11.at: Replace "((" with "( (" in shell scripts, as
	"((" is not portable to the Korn shell, and POSIX 1003.1-2008 says
	that "((" is not portable.

2010-10-26  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Make sure name matching occurs before name transformation.
	The commit 9c194c99 altered that order.

	* src/list.c (transform_stat_info): New function.  Split off from
	decode_header.
	(read_and): Call transform_stat_info right before do_something,
	and after deciding if we should proceed with this member name,
	so that name matching occurs before name transformation.

	* tests/extrac17.at: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add extrac17.at
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include extrac17.at.

2010-10-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: don't assume stdin is open when testing fd limits
	* tests/extrac11.at: Redirect stdin from /dev/null, in case
	the parent 'make' is running with stdin closed.

2010-10-26  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Further fixes in bootstrap.
	* bootstrap: Restore the default for gnulib_path
	(symlink_to_dir): Re-apply 67cad07.

2010-10-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: fix bug with -C and extracting directories
	Problem reported by Denis Excoffier in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-10/msg00034.html>.

	* src/extract.c (extract_dir): Use mkdirat, not mkdir.
	* tests/extrac16.at: New file, to test for this bug.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add it.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

	This file is a placeholder. It will be replaced with the actual
	ChangeLog
	by make dist.  Run make ChangeLog if you wish to create it
	earlier.

2010-10-25  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Version 1.24
	* configure.ac, NEWS: Version 1.24
	* bootstrap: Restore tar-specific code lost during last
	sync from gnulib (241b72ffad).
	* src/misc.c (chdir_do): Remove unused automatic variable.

2010-10-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: use more-accurate diagnostic when intermediate mkdir fails
	Without this change, if tar tried to extract a file A/B/C, noticed
	that A/B didn't exist, attempted to mkdir A/B, and the mkdir
	failed, it did not diagnose the mkdir failure, but simply reported
	the failure to open A/B/C.  This sometimes led to confusion
	because it wasn't clear what tar was trying to do, in particular
	that tar tried to mkdir A/B.  With this patch, tar issues two
	diagnostics in this case: one for A/B and the other for A/B/C.
	Problem reported by Hauke Laging in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-10/msg00020.html>.
	* gnulib.modules: Remove faccessat.
	* src/extract.c (make_directories): New arg INTERDIR_MADE.
	Diagnose mkdir failure.  Return 0 on success, nonzero on failure,
	as opposed to nonzero iff some directory was created.  All callers
	changed.  Simplify the code when mkdir fails, by checking whether
	the desired file exists unless errno==EEXIST: this is more robust.
	* tests/extrac15.at: New test, to check this.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add it.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

	tests: port to NFS file servers with clock skew
	Several of the tests assumed that a newly created file cannot
	have a time stamp dated in the future.	This assumption is not
	true when files are served by a remote host whose clock is
	slightly in advance of ours.  Fix the problems that I observed
	when running "make check" a couple of times on such a server.

	* tests/backup01.at: Use --warning=no-timestamp to suppress
	clock-skew warnings.
	* tests/chtype.at, tests/comprec.at, tests/exclude06.at:
	* tests/extrac01.at, tests/extrac03.at, tests/extrac05.at:
	* tests/extrac06.at, tests/extrac08.at, tests/extrac13.at:
	* tests/extrac14.at, tests/incr01.at, tests/incr03.at,
	tests/link01.at:
	* tests/multiv01.at, tests/multiv02.at, tests/multiv03.at:
	* tests/pipe.at, tests/rename02.at, tests/rename03.at:
	* tests/rename05.at, tests/same-order01.at, tests/same-order02.at:
	* tests/sparse01.at:
	Likewise.

2010-10-12  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	gnulib: sync from latest gnulib, notably bootstrap and
	parse-datetime
	* bootstrap: Sync from gnulib.
	* doc/.gitignore: Rename getdate.texi to parse-datetime.texi.
	* doc/Makefile.am (tar_TEXINFOS): Likewise.
	* doc/tar.texi (Top): Adjust to renaming of getdate to
	parse-datetime.
	* gnulib.modules: Likewise.  Also, remove ftruncate (now
	obsolete).
	And add inttostr (we missed this dependency).
	* src/tar.c: Include parse-datetime.h, not getdate.h.  All calls
	to get_date replaced with parse_datetime.

2010-09-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: -x -C symlink fix
	* src/misc.c (chdir_do): Don't use O_NOFOLLOW when opening the
	argument to -C.  This is for consistency with "tar -c -C FOO", and
	matches the new documentation.
	* tests/extrac14.at: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add it.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

	tar: --dereference consistency
	This closes another race condition, that occurs when overwriting a
	symlink with a regular file.
	* NEWS (--dereference consistency): New section.
	* doc/tar.texi (Option Summary): Describe new --deference
	behavior.
	(dereference): Likewise.  Remove discussion that I didn't follow,
	even before --dereference was changed.
	* src/common.h (deref_stat, set_file_atime): Adjust signatures.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file, diff_multivol): Respect
	open_read_flags
	instead of rolling our own flags.  This implements the new
	behavior
	for --dereference.
	(diff_file, diff_dumpdir): Likewise, for fstatat_flags.
	* src/create.c: Adjust to set_file_atime signature change.
	* src/extract.c (mark_after_links, file_newer_p, extract_dir):
	Likewise.
	* src/incremen.c (try_purge_directory): Likewise.
	* src/misc.c (maybe_backup_file): Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (file_newer_p): New arg STP.  All callers changed.
	(maybe_recoverable): New arg REGULAR.  All callers changed.
	Handle the case of overwriting a symlink with a regular file,
	when --overwrite is specified but --dereference is not.
	(open_output_file): Add O_CLOEXEC, O_NOCTTY, O_NONBLOCK for
	consistency with file creation.  Add O_NOFOLLOW if
	overwriting_old_files && ! dereference_option.
	* src/incremen.c (update_parent_directory): Use fstat, not
	fstatat;
	there's less to go wrong.
	* src/misc.c (deref_stat): Remove DEREF arg.  All callers changed.
	Instead, use fstatat_flags.
	(set_file_atime): Remove ATFLAG arg.  All callers changed.
	Instead, use fstatat_flags.
	* src/names.c, src/update.c: Adjust to deref_stat signature
	change.
	* src/tar.c (get_date_or_file): Use stat, not deref_stat, as this
	is not a file to be archived.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add extrac13.at.
	* tests/extrac13.at: New file.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

2010-09-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: do not crash with --listed-incremental
	Problem reported by Frantisek Hanzlik in
	<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/635318> via Kamil Dudka in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-09/msg00066.html>.
	I don't understand this code either, but Sergey can take a look at
	this patch, and perhaps install a better one, when he has
	the time.
	* src/incremen.c (append_incremental_renames): Don't actually
	append
	anything to DIR if DIR is null.

2010-09-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: prefer openat-style functions
	This change replaces traditional functions like 'open' with the
	POSIX.1-2008 functions like 'openat'.  Mostly this is an internal
	refactoring change, in preparation for further changes to close
	some races.
	* gnulib.modules: Add faccessat, linkat, mkfifoat, renameat,
	symlinkat.
	Remove save-cwd.
	* src/Makefile.am (tar_LDADD): Add $(LIB_EACCESS).
	* tests/Makefile.am (LDADD): Likewise.
	* src/common.h (chdir_fd): New extern var.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file, diff_multivol): Use openat instead
	of open.
	* src/create.c (create_archive, restore_parent_fd): Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (create_placeholder_file): Likewise.
	* src/names.c (collect_and_sort_names): Likewise.
	* src/update.c (append_file): Likewise.
	* src/compare.c (diff_symlink): Use readlinkat instead of
	readlink.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file): Use chdir_fd instead of AT_FDCWD.
	* src/create.c (subfile_open, dump_file0): Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (fd_chmod, fd_chown, fd_stat, set_stat):
	(repair_delayed_set_stat, apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat):
	Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (mark_after_links, file_newer_p, extract_dir):
	(extract_link, apply_delayed_links):
	Use fstatat rather than stat or lstat.
	* src/misc.c (maybe_backup_file, deref_stat): Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (make_directories): Use mkdirat rather than mkdir.
	Use faccessat rather than access.  This fixes a minor permissions
	bug when tar is running setuid (who would want to do that?!).
	(open_output_file): Use openat rather than open.
	In the process, this removes support for Masscomp's O_CTG files,
	which aren't compatible with openat's signature.  Masscomp!  Wow!
	That's a blast from the past.  As far as I know, that operating
	system hasn't been supported for more than 20 years.
	(extract_link, apply_delayed_links):
	Use linkat rather than link.
	(extract_symlink, apply_delayed_links):
	Use symlinkat rather than symlink.
	(extract_node): Use mknodat rather than mknod.
	(extract_fifo): Use mkfifoat rather than mkfifo.
	(apply_delayed_links): Use unlinkat rather than unlink or rmdir.
	* src/misc.c (safer_rmdir, remove_any_file): Likewise.
	* src/unlink.c (flush_deferred_unlinks): Likewise.
	* src/extract.c (rename_directory): Use renameat rather than
	rename.
	* src/misc.c (maybe_backup_file, undo_last_backup): Likewise.
	* src/misc.c: Don't include <save-cwd.h>; no longer needed now
	that we're using openat etc.
	(struct wd): Add member fd.  Remove members err and fd.  All uses
	changed.
	(CHDIR_CACHE_SIZE): New constant.
	(wdcache, wdcache_count, chdir_fd): New vars.
	(chdir_do): Use openat rather than save_cwd.  Keep the cache up
	to date.  This code won't scale well, but is good enough for now.
	* src/update.c (update_archive): Use openat + fdopendir +
	streamsavedir rather than savedir.

	This file is a placeholder. It will be replaced with the actual
	ChangeLog
	by make dist.  Run make ChangeLog if you wish to create it
	earlier.

2010-09-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: add utimens.h includes
	* src/extract.c: Include <utimens.h>, needed for fdutimens
	prototype.
	* src/misc.c: Likewise.

	tar: switch to gnulib fdutimensat module
	* gnulib.modules: Add fdutimensat.
	* src/common.h (fd_utimensat): Remove decl.
	* src/extract.c (set_stat): Call fdutimensat, not fd_utimensat.
	* src/misc.c (set_file_atime): Likewise.
	(fd_utimensat): Remove.

2010-09-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: extract permissions for . last
	* src/common.h (must_be_dot_or_slash): New decl.
	* src/extract.c (mark_after_links): New function, taking code
	that used to be in create_placeholder_file.
	(create_placeholder_file): Use it.
	(delay_set_stat): Always delay setting status for . and /.
	* src/misc.c (must_be_dot_or_slash): Now extern.
	* tests/extrac12.at: New file.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add it.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Likewise.

	tar: don't check for getdtablesize; use AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE
	* configure.ac: Don't check for getdtablesize; no longer needed.
	Use AC_CHECK_FUNCS_ONCE rather than AC_CHECK_FUNCS, for
	efficiency.

	tar: extract symlink attributes, close some symlink-related races
	* NEWS: Describe symlink-extraction improvements.
	* src/extract.c (enum permstatus): Remove.
	(fchmod, fchown): Define dummy replacement macros if the system
	does not supply them.
	(implemented): New function.
	(struct delayed_set_stat): Remove members invert_permissions,
	permstatus.  They were too confusing, and tried to do too much
	in too-little space.  Instead, add members current_mode,
	current_mode_mask, interdir, atflag.  All users changed.
	(struct delayed_link): Add members mode, atime, mtime, to support
	platforms such as BSD where symlinks have these attributes.
	All users changed.
	(fd_chmod): Renamed from fdchmod.  New argument atflag.  Check for
	operation not supported at run-time, not at configure-time.  Put
	fd argument first.  All callers changed.
	(fd_chown): Likewise, renaming from fdchown.
	(fd_stat): Likewise, renaming from fdstat.
	(set_mode): Remove args stat_info, cur_info, invert_permissions,
	permstatus.  Add args mode, mode_mask, current_mode,
	current_mode_mask,
	atflag.  All callers changed.  Close some races.  Use an easier-to
	understand method for computing permissions.  Work around POSIX
	incompatibility in Linux fchmodat.  Support extraction of symlink
	modes, if the OS allows it.
	(set_stat): Remove args cur_info, invert_permissions, permstatus.
	Add args current_mode, current_mode_mask, interdir, atflag.
	All callers changed.  Close some races.  Support extraction of
	attributes on symlinks, if the OS allows it.
	(delay_set_stat): Remove args invert_permissions, permstatus.
	Add args current_mode, current_mode_mask, mode, atflag.
	The ST arg can be null now, indicating that it's an intermediate
	directory.  All callers changed.
	(repair_delayed_set_stat, apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat):
	Close some races.
	(extract_dir): Also be paranoid if only --same-permissions, due
	to semantics of setgid and setuid directories on some hosts.
	This closes a race on those hosts.  Simplify calculation of
	delay_set_stat arguments; the old code was truly strange and
	probably wrong in some border cases.
	(extract_dir, extract_file, extract_node, extract_fifo): Don't
	rely on
	unspecified behavior in mode arg of open, mknod, etc.  Instead,
	mask out those bits when creating the file, and add them later via
	fchmod or chmodat.
	(open_output_file): file_name is now const.  Add arg current_mode,
	current_mode_mask.  All callers changed.  When overwriting
	old files,
	refuse to overwrite something that is not a regular file, since
	we're extracting a regular file.
	(extract_file): Remove the FIXME comment.  Whatever the protection
	issues were, they should be fixed now.	As a result of all
	the other
	API changes, we now use fchmod etc. rather than chmod etc.,
	closing
	some races.
	(create_placeholder_file, apply_delayed_links): Record desired
	mode and times for symlinks, for OSes that support that.

2010-09-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: tar -x without --incremental no longer sets atime again
	* src/extract.c (set_stat): Use UTIME_OMIT rather than UTIME_NOW.
	The UTIME_NOW was there only to emulate the previous behavior of
	using the current time, and the previous behavior was there only
	because before we started assuming POSIX.1-2008 there was no
	portable way to get the effect of UTIME_NOW.

	tar: another --atime-preserve race fix
	* src/common.h (set_file_atime): Add parentfd arg.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file): Use it.
	* src/create.c (dump_file0): Likewise.	This closes yet another
	race condition with symbolic links.
	* src/misc.c (set_file_atime): Add parentfd arg.

	tar: --atime-preserve fixes for races etc.
	This patch fixes a race condition in the --atime-preserve=replace
	option, which might cause tar to improperly follow a symbolic
	link.

	It also drops the use of the _FIOSATIME ioctl of Solaris 2.x
	and later, which loses resolution on time stamps.  Modern Solaris
	systems support full-resolution time stamps in the kernel, and
	it's not worth the hassle of testing this call, useful only in
	no-longer-supported Solaris variants.

	Also, it undoes a change I recently introduced to the --compare
	option, which caused it to not follow symbolic links unless the
	--dereference option was also used.  Quite possibly this change is
	a good idea, but the old behavior was documented and the change
	should not have been installed casually.

	* configure.ac: Don't check for stropts.h and sys/filio.h.
	* gnulib.modules: Add futimens, utimensat.  Remove futimens.
	* src/common.h (fd_utimensat): New decl.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file, diff_multivol):
	Don't use open_read_flags: those are for --create only.
	* src/create.c (dump_file0): Adjust to set_file_atime changes.
	Pass fstatat_flags to set_file_atime, so that symbolic links are
	not followed inadvertantly.
	* src/extract.c: Don't include utimens.h.
	(set_stat): Use fd_utimensat ant UTIME_NOW rather than fdutimens.
	* src/misc.c: Don't include utimens.h, stropts.h, sys/filio.h.
	(fd_utimensat): New function.
	(set_file_atime): Use it.  New arg atflag, controlling symlink
	handling.  All callers changed.

2010-09-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac: tar: close some race conditions when extracting
	* configure.ac: Check for fchmod and fchown.  Don't check
	for utimes.
	* src/extract.c (fdchmod, fdchown, fdstat): New functions.
	(set_mode, set_stat): New arg FD.  All callers changed.
	This avoids some race conditions between closing a regular file
	and setting its metadata, and it's a bit faster.

2010-09-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: don't worry about fdopendir closing its argument
	* NEWS: Don't mention dirfd; no longer needed.
	* gnulib.modules: Remove dirfd.
	* src/create.c (get_directory_entries): Remove the code dealing
	with dirfd failures, as the new fdopendir replacement doesn't
	close its argument so we don't need to call dirfd.  See
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2010-09/msg00208.html>
	and gnulib commit 970c9038e4cca46e1b037ae0a6d574dfae6a7327.

	* NEWS: Fix wording typo in previous change.
	Reported by Jim Meyering.

	tar: live within system-supplied limits on file descriptors
	* NEWS: Note the change.  Mention dirfd and fdopendir.
	* gnulib.modules: Add dirfd and fdopendir.  The code was already
	using fdopendir; dirfd is a new need.
	* src/common.h (open_searchdir_flags, get_directory_entries):
	(subfile_open, restore_parent_fd, tar_stat_close): New decls.
	(check_exclusion_tags): Adjust signature to match code change.
	* src/create.c (IMPOSTOR_ERRNO): New constant.
	(check_exclusion_tags): First arg is now a struct tar_stat_info
	const *, not an fd.  All callers changed.
	(dump_regular_file, dump_file0): A zero fd represents an unused
	slot, so play it safe if the fd member is zero here.  A negative
	fd represents the negation of an errno value, so play it safe and
	do not assign -1 to fd merely because an open fails.
	(open_failure_recover, get_directory_entries, restore_parent_fd):
	(subfile_open): New functions.	These help to recover from file
	descriptor exhaustion.
	(dump_dir, dump_file0): Use them.
	(dump_file0): Use tar_stat_close instead of rolling our own close.
	* src/incremen.c (scan_directory): Use get_directory_entries,
	subfile_open, etc., to recover from file descriptor exhaustion.
	* src/names.c (add_hierarchy_to_namelist): Likewise.
	(collect_and_sort_names): A negative fd represents the negation
	of an errno value, so play it safe and do not assign -1 to fd.
	* src/tar.c (decode_options): Set open_searchdir_flags.
	Add O_CLOEXEC to all the open flags.
	(tar_stat_close): New function, which knows how to deal with
	new convention for directory streams and file descriptors.
	Diagnose 'close' failures.
	(tar_stat_destroy): Use it.
	* src/tar.h (struct tar_stat_info): New member dirstream.
	fd now has the negative of an errno value, not merely -1, if
	the file could not be opened, so that failures to reopen
	directories
	are better-diagnosed later.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add extrac11.at.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Likewise.
	* tests/extrac11.at: New file.

2010-09-08  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: improve documentation of reliability and security issues
	* doc/tar.texi (Reliability and security, Reliability):
	(Permissions problems, Data corruption and repair, Race
	conditions):
	(Security, Privacy, Integrity, Live untrusted data):
	(Security rules of thumb): New nodes.

2010-09-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: more reliable directory traversal when creating archives
	* NEWS: Document this.
	* gnulib.modules: Add openat, readlinkat.
	* src/common.h (open_read_flags, fstatat_flags): New global
	variables.
	(cachedir_file_p, dump_file, check_exclusion_tags,
	scan_directory):
	Adjust to new signatures, described below.
	(name_fill_directory): Remove.
	* src/compare.c (diff_file, diff_multivol): Use open_read_flags.
	* src/create.c (struct exclusion_tag): Exclusion predicates
	now take
	a file descriptor, not a file name.
	(add_exclusion_tag): Likewise.	All uses changed.
	(cachedir_file_p): Likewise.
	(check_exclusion_tags): The directory is now a file descriptor,
	not a file name.  All uses changed.  Use openat for better
	traversal.
	(file_dumpable_p): Arg is now a struct stat, not a struct
	tar_stat_info.	All uses changed.  Check the arg's file types too.
	(dump_dir0, dump_dir, dump_file0, dump_file): Omit top_level and
	parent_device args, since st->parent tells us that now.  All uses
	changed.
	(dump_dir): Likewise.  Also, omit fd arg for similar reasons.
	Apply fdsavedir to a dup of the file descriptor, since we need a
	file descriptor for openat etc. as well, and fdsavedir (perhaps
	unwisely) consumes its file descriptor when successful.
	Do not consume st->fd when successful; this simplifies the caller.
	(create_archive): Allocate a file descriptor when retraversing
	a directory, during incremental dumps.
	(dump_file0): Use fstatat, openat, and readlinkat for better
	traversal.
	When opening a file, use the result of fstat on the file
	descriptor
	rather than the fstatat on the directory entry, to avoid some race
	conditions.  No need to reopen the directory since we now
	no longer
	close it.  Change "did we open the file?" test from 0 <= fd to
	0 < fd since fd == 0 now represents uninitialized.
	(dump_file): Now accepts struct tar_stat_info describing parent,
	not parent_device.  Also, accept basename and fullname of entry.
	All uses changed.
	* src/incremen.c (update_parent_directory): Accept struct
	tar_stat_info for parent, not name.  All callers changed.
	Use fstatat for safer directory traversal.
	(procdir): Accept struct tar_stat_info, not struct stat and
	dev_t, for info about directory.  All callers changed.
	(scan_directory): Accept struct tar_stat_info, not name,
	device, and cmdline, for info about directory.	All callers
	changed.  Do not consume the file descriptor, since caller
	might need it.	Use fstatat and openat for safer directory
	traversal; also, use fstat after opening to double-check.
	(name_fill_directory): Remove.
	* src/names.c (add_hierarchy_to_namelist): Accept struct
	tar_stat_info instead of device and cmdline.  All callers changed.
	When descending into a subdirectory, use openat and fstat for
	safer directory traversal.
	(collect_and_sort_names): Use open and fstat for safer directory
	traversal.  Set up struct tar_stat_info for callee's new API.
	* src/tar.c (decode_options): Initialize open_read_flags
	and fstatat_flags.
	(tar_stat_destroy): Close st->fd if it is positive (not zero!).
	* src/tar.h (struct tar_stat_info): New members parent, fd.
	* src/update.c (update_archive): Adjust to dump_file's API change.
	* tests/filerem02.at: Ignore stderr since its contents now depend
	on the file system implementation.

2010-09-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: remove lint discovered by Sun C compiler
	* src/common.h (WARN_ALL): Don't mask with 0xffffffff; on a 32-bit
	host, 0xffffffff is of type 'unsigned int', which makes WARN_ALL
	an unsigned int value that is too large to fit into an int, and
	the C standard says that this has undefined behavior.  The mask is
	not needed, so omit it.

2010-09-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: restore macros that are used in some cases
	* src/tar.c (LOW_DENSITY_NUM, MID_DENSITY_NUM, HIGH_DENSITY_NUM):
	Restore these macros, undoing the previous change to this file.
	The macros are used after all, in some cases.  Sorry about that.

2010-09-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: remove unused macros
	* src/create.c (UINTMAX_TO_CHARS): Remove; no longer used.
	* src/tar.c (LOW_DENSITY_NUM, MID_DENSITY_NUM, HIGH_DENSITY_NUM):
	Likewise.
	* src/incremen.c (DIR_IS_NEW): Comment out; not used.
	Mark this with a FIXME, since it looks like it should be used.

2010-08-27  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Fix --remove-files in update/append mode.
	* src/update.c (update_archive): Call finish_deferred_unlinks when
	done.

2010-08-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: avoid assumptions about root access and chmod -w in test
	cases
	* tests/extrac07.at, tests/extrac09.at, tests/listed03.at: Use
	AT_UNPRIVILEGED_PREREQ, since this test requires non-root
	privileges.
	* tests/extrac07.at: Don't use "chmod -w", as POSIX says it's not
	portable to start a chmod permissions-list with "-" as it may be
	confused with an option.  Use "chmod a-w" instead.

	tar: fix bug with -C and delayed setting of metadata
	* src/common.h (chdir_current): New decl.
	* src/extract.c (struct delayed_set_stat, struct delayed_link):
	New member change_dir.
	(delay_set_stat, create_placeholder_file): Set it.
	(apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat, apply_delayed_links): Use it.
	(extract_link): Check that the links are all relative to the same
	directory.
	(extract_archive): Restore the current directory after
	apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat has possibly changed it.
	* src/misc.c (chdir_current): New external var; this used to
	be the private static variable 'previous' inside chdir_dir.
	All uses changed.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): New test extrac10.at.
	* tests/extrac10.at: New file.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

2010-08-25  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Don't apply file transformations to volume names.
	* src/list.c (decode_header): Don't apply file transformations
	to volume names.
	* tests/xform01.at: New testcase.
	* tests/xform-h.at (xform): Rename macro to xformtest. Use
	pushdef/popdef.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/testsuite.at: Add xform01.at

2010-08-25  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: optimize -c --sparse when file is entirely sparse
	* src/sparse.c (sparse_scan_file): If the file is entirely sparse,
	that is, if ST_NBLOCKS is zero, don't bother scanning for nonzero
	blocks.  Idea by Kit Westneat, communicated by Bernd Schubert in
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-08/msg00038.html>.
	Also, omit unnecessary lseek at start of file.

	tar: don't assume size of a sparse file chunk fits in size_t
	* src/tar.h (struct sp_array): Change numbytes from size_t
	to off_t.
	All uses changed.
	* scripts/xsparse.c (struct sp_array): Likewise.
	Include <stdint.h>, for SIZE_MAX.
	(expand_sparse): Don't try to allocate a buffer bigger than
	SIZE_MAX bytes.
	* src/common.h (SIZE_TO_CHARS, size_to_chars, SIZE_FROM_HEADER):
	(size_from_header): Remove decls.
	* src/create.c (size_to_chars): Remove.
	* src/list.c (size_from_header): Remove.
	* src/sparse.c (sparse_extract_region, check_data_region):
	(oldgnu_add_sparse, oldgnu_store_sparse_info, pax_decode_header):
	Don't assume chunk sizes fit in size_t.
	(oldgnu_add_sparse): Check for off_t overflow.
	* src/xheader.c (sparse_numbytes_decoder, sparse_map_decoder):
	Likewise.

	tar: use ctime, not mtime, when checking placeholders
	* src/extract.c (struct delayed_link): Rename member mtime
	to ctime.
	All uses changed to use ctime rather than mtime.

2010-08-24  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: add comment to link04.at test
	* tests/link04.at: Add explanatory comment at head.

	tar: fix 1.23 Solaris regression related to PRIV_SYS_LINKDIR
	The idea was suggested by Petr Sumbera in the thread starting
	here:
	http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-tar/2010-08/msg00000.html
	* src/extract.c (set_mode): Save the errno of the chmod that
	failed, for the benefit of chmod_error_details.  Do not bother
	retrying chmod unless the mode suggests setuid is the issue.
	(extract_archive): Remove redundant call to
	priv_set_remove_linkdir.
	* src/system.c: Include priv-set.h.
	(sys_spawn_shell, sys_child_open_for_compress):
	(sys_child_open_for_uncompress, sys_exec_command):
	(sys_exec_info_script, sys_exec_checkpoint_script):
	Invoke priv_set_restore_linkdir before execv or execlp, so that
	the subprocess has the same privileges that tar originally did.

	tar: handle files that occur multiple times but have link count 1
	This patch was inspired by the following patch that addressed a
	similar problem in GNU coreutils du:
	http://git.savannah.gnu.org/gitweb/?p=coreutils.git;h=efe53cc72b599979ea292754ecfe8abf7c839d22
	* src/common.h (name_count): New decl.
	* src/create.c (trivial_link_count): New static var.
	(create_archive): Initialize it.
	(dump_hard_link, file_count_links): Use it, so that files with
	link count 1 are handled correctly when they are found multiple
	times.
	* src/names.c (allocated_entries): Renamed from allocated_names,
	since the identifier's name was misleading.  All uses changed.
	(entries): Renamed from names.	All uses changed.
	(scanned): Renamed from name_index.  All uses changed.
	(name_count): New var.
	(name_add_name): Increment it.
	* tests/link04.at: New file.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Add it.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Likewise.

2010-08-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: use nlink_t for link counts

	(time_from_header, uid_from_header, quote_copy_string,
	request_stdin):
	(xheader_init, transform_header_name):
	Remove declarations; these are no longer exported from their
	modules.
	(GID_TO_CHARS, MAJOR_TO_CHARS, MINOR_TO_CHARS, MODE_TO_CHARS):
	(UID_TO_CHARS, UINTMAX_TO_CHARS, UNAME_TO_CHARS, GNAME_TO_CHARS):
	Move to src/create.c, since no other module uses these.
	(GID_FROM_HEADER, MAJOR_FROM_HEADER, MINOR_FROM_HEADER):
	(MODE_FROM_HEADER, TIME_FROM_HEADER, UID_FROM_HEADER):
	Move to src/extract.c, since no other module uses these.
	(dumpdir_t, dumpdir_iter_t): Remove; no longer used.
	* src/create.c (gid_to_chars, major_to_chars, minor_to_chars):
	(mode_to_chars, uid_to_chars, uintmax_to_chars, string_to_chars):

	(scan_directory, write_directory_file_entry):
	Use struct dumpdir_iter * rather than dumpdir_iter_t.
	* src/list.c (gid_from_header, major_from_header,
	minor_from_header):
	(mode_from_header, time_from_header, uid_from_header):
	(transform_member_name): Now static.
	* src/misc.c (quote_copy_string): #if 0 out, as it's not used
	anywhere.

	* src/buffer.c, src/common.h, src/tar.c: All uses changed.

2010-08-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: change interdir_made from int to bool
	* src/extract.c (maybe_recoverable, create_placeholder_file):
	Change interdir_made from int * to bool *, since the flag has just
	two values 0 and 1.  All uses changed.	This does not affect tar's
	behavior.

	tar: remove trailing white space from source files

	to share code among coreutils and other projects that do this.

2010-08-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: update licenses to latest versions from www.gnu.org
	* COPYING: Update to latest version; this is just minor
	formatting.
	* doc/fdl.texi: Update from GFDL 1.2 to 1.3.
	* doc/tar.texi: Adjust to new format of fdl.texi.  Omit trailing
	white space.

2010-07-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/misc.c (struct wd): Fix comment to match code.

2010-07-18  Paul R. Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: no need to report getcwd error if never using the result
	* src/misc.c (struct wd): Rename 'saved' to 'err', with new
	semantics.
	(chdir_arg, chdir_do): Adjust to new semantics.  Do not report an
	error merely because save_cwd fails; report an error only if
	save_cwd's result is needed later.
	* tests/extrac09.at: New file, to test for bug that was fixed.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add it.

	tar: go back to absolutifying filenames in normalize_filename
	for now
	* src/misc.c (normalize_filename): For now, go back to making
	filenames absolute, even though this causes 'tar' to fail when
	getcwd fails.  However, do not attempt to resolve ".." as this
	does not work with symlinks.  Also, do the right thing with
	leading file system prefixes and on hosts where // != /.

2010-07-17  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Allow for size suffixes in -L and --record-size options.
	* src/tar.c (TAR_SIZE_SUFFIXES): New define.
	(parse_opt): Allow for size suffixes in arguments to
	-L and --record-size options.
	* NEWS, doc/tar.texi: Update.

2010-07-15  Paul R. Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	tar: don't crash if getcwd fails
	* src/extract.c: Don't include xgetcwd.h.
	(extract_dir): stat "." rather than statting getcwd's output.
	* src/misc.c (normalize_filename_x): Rewrite so as not to resolve
	/../, which can't be done reliably in the presence of symlinks.
	Don't reject valid names such as ".".
	(normalize_filename): Don't make it absolute; that way, we don't
	have to invoke xgetcwd which might fail.  Don't bother to realloc
	at the end, since that uses time and now saves little space.
	(chdir_do): Don't crash if xgetcwd fails.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add listed03.at.
	* tests/listed03.at: New file.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include listed03.at.

2010-07-11  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Keep a detailed map of archive members stored in the record

	* src/common.h (mv_begin_write): New prototype.
	(mv_begin): Rename to mv_begin_read.
	* src/create.c: Use mv_begin_write instead of mv_begin.
	Remove calls to mv_size_left and mv_end.
	* src/sparse.c: Likewise.

	* tests/multiv07.at: Close stdin.
	* tests/spmvp00.at: Update AT_KEYWORDS.
	* tests/spmvp10.at: Likewise.

	* tests/multiv08.at: New testcase.
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/testsuite.at: Add multiv08.at.

	Version 1.23.90
	* NEWS, configure.ac: Version 1.23.90
	* doc/tar.texi: Document the use of lbzip2.

2010-06-28  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Fix exclusion of long file names when extracting from pax format
	archives.
	* src/list.c (read_and): Call decode_header before attempting
	name_match.
	(list_archive): Remove call to decode_header.

	* src/compare.c (diff_archive): Remove call to decode_header.
	* src/extract.c (extract_archive): Likewise.

	* test/exclude06.at: New test case.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include exclude06.at.
	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTSUITE_AT): Add exclude06.at.

	Minor fix.
	* src/buffer.c (magic): Split the character constant to help
	cc recognize character boundaries (7 is a valid hex character).

2010-06-27  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	* src/buffer.c (set_volume_start_time, compress_type):
	(guess_seekable_archive, open_compressed_archive, init_buffer):

	* src/extract.c (extract_node): Don't return garbage.

	* src/names.c: Remove old-style declarations of getgrnam etc.
	All modern systems declare these, and it's not worth the hassle
	of ignoring the warnings on modern systems for old-style decls.

2010-05-17  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Bugfix.
	* src/incremen.c (make_directory): Retain the slash if it is the

2010-03-17  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	Fix --remove-files.
	Tar --remove-files relied on canonicalize_file_name,
	which replaces symlinks in file name components with
	the directories they point to. Due to this, tar
	effectively ignored existence of symbolic links and
	was unable to remove a directory that contained any
	(Alexander Kozlov <akozlov@nada.kth.se>, 2010-03-15).

	* gnulib.modules: Remove canonicalize.
	* src/misc.c (normalize_filename): Rewrite

	components for existence or to resolve symbolic
	links.

	Fix eventual memory override and fd exhaustion in create.c
	Both bugs reported by Kamil Dudka.

	* src/create.c (check_exclusion_tags): Do not keep

	All callers updated.
	* src/buffer.c (try_new_volume): Allow for volumes split at the

	(format_default_settings): Use xasprintf.
	(parse_opt): Use *_PROGRAM defines instead of hardcoded
	program names.

	Allow installers to specify alternative program names for
	compression programs.
	This adds --with-gzip, --with-bzip2 etc. switches to the
	configure, so that
	one can do, e.g. ./configure --with-bzip2=lbzip2 and have
	lbzip2 executed
	whenever user calls `tar --bzip2'.

	* acinclude.m4: New file.

	Provide a way to explicitly set mtime for extended header
	ustar blocks.
	* src/tar.c (struct textual_date): ts is a copy of the structure,

	Use file's mtime as mtime for its extended header.
	This makes two pax archives binary equivalent if they
	have the same contents and care is taken to make extended
	headers otherwise reproducible, e.g. by using:

	  --pax-option=exthdr.name=%d/PaxHeaders/%f,atime:=0

	* src/extract.c (extract_archive): Set fatal_exit_hook.
	(fatal_exit, xalloc_die): Move to exit.c
	* src/system.c (sys_wait_for_child): Exit immediately
	if the child dies or exits with a non-zero status.
	(sys_child_open_for_compress)
	(sys_child_open_for_uncompress): Use set_program_name,
	instead of setting program_name directly.
	* src/tar.c (main): Use set_program_name,
	instead of setting program_name directly.

	fcntl.h, fcntl_.h, inttypes_.h, lstat.c, lstat.h.
	* tests/testsuite.at (AT_TAR_MKHIER): Use install-sh -d

	and m4/inttypes-pri.m4

2006-08-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap: Set XGETTEXT_OPTIONS to flag our printf-format functions,
	so that translators are warned about strings that are formats but
	don't look like formats.  This might help prevent core dumps.
	* configure.ac (AM_GNU_GETTEXT): Upgrade to need-formatstring-macros.
	Suggested by Eric Blake to avoid problems like
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-coreutils/2006-07/msg00087.html>.
	(AM_GNU_GETTEXT_VERSION): Upgrade from 0.12.1 to 0.15.  The gettext
	manual says we should use the version number normally expected of
	maintainers, neither more nor less.

	* bootstrap (get_translations):
	Don't exclude ky.po; it is working again.

2006-08-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap (get_translations):
	Don't exclude ja.po; it is working again.
	Don't remove all old .po files if we're merely updating one.
	* po/.cvsignore: Add Makevars.

2006-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/tar.c: Work around limitation imposed by gettext 0.15
	by concatenating strings with "\v" after translation.
	(doc): Remove, splitting into:
	(doc0, doc1): New constants.
	(argp): Don't use doc; just initialize to NULL.
	(initialize_argp_doc): New function.
	(decode_options): Use it.

	* bootstrap: Redo po file retrieval to match Bison's method,
	since the translation project changed its index format.
	Don't use --assume-autoconf; it's now replaced
	by looking in configure.ac.
	(m4/codeset.m4, m4/intdiv.m4, m4/inttypes-pri.m4, m4/isc-posix.m4):
	(m4/lcmessage.m4, m4/onceonly_2_57.m4, m4/gettext.m4, m4/glibc21.m4):
	(m4/inttypes_h.m4, m4/lib-ld.m4, m4/lib-prefix.m4, m4/po.m4):
	(m4/stdint_h.m4, m4/uintmax_t.m4, m4/ulonglong.m4):
	Don't rename to ..._gl.m4, as this is no longer needed.
	(m4/geteext.m4): Patch to remove the need for intl/*.
	Use autopoint manually, then remove the intl files,
	then undo changes to gnulib files that autoreconf made,
	and then run aclocal/autoconf/autoheader/automake.
	This makes our bootstrap procedure closer to Bison's.
	(po/Makevars): Generate automatically.
	* configure.ac (AC_PREREQ): Update from 2.59 to 2.60.
	(gl_AC_TYPE_INTMAX_T, jm_AC_TYPE_UINTMAX_T): Remove.
	* gnulib.modules: Add inttypes, stdint.
	* lib/.cvsignore: Add close-stream.c, close-stream.h,
	stdint.h, stdint_.h.
	* po/Makefile: Remove; now automatically generated.

	* src/incremen.c (read_incr_db_01): Check input strings more
	carefully.  Do not pass arbitrary char values to isspace, as
	this has undefined behavior.  Likewise for assigning arbitrary
	uintmax_t values to other types.
	(read_negative_num, read_unsigned_num, read_timespec):
	New functions, to check input values a bit more carefuly.
	(read_num): Use read_unsigned_num.  New arg MAX_VAL;
	all callers changed.
	(read_incr_db_2): Use these new functions.
	Use a consistent diagnostic for unexpected EOF.
	(read_directory_file): Do not assign arbitrary uintmax_t value
	to int.
	(read_timespec, write_directory_file_entry, write_directory_file):
	Handle negative time_t values correctly.  We don't bother to do
	this with pre-2 formats, since presumably the time stamps were
	output incorrectly.

	* src/tar.c (doc): Don't use \v in an argument to gettext;
	gettext 0.15 rejects this.

2006-07-24  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@gnu.org.ua>

	* src/tar.c (decode_options): Do not require -L with -M -Hpax.
	It could be needed in future, but currently it is not.
	* src/create.c (to_chars_subst): Update comment regarding OLDGNU
	vs. GNU format differences.
	(mode_to_chars): Treat OLDGNU_FORMAT same as GNU_FORMAT. Fixes bug
	reported by TAMUKI Shoichi <tamuki@linet.gr.jp>, which caused
	equivalent `tar cf ...' and `tar rf ...' commands to produce
	different archives.

	* tests/append02.at: New test case
	* tests/Makefile.am, tests/testsuite.at: Add append02.at

	FIXME.

2005-11-29  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* THANKS: Add Ian Turner.

	* configure.ac: Prefer AC_CHECK_HEADERS_ONCE to AC_CHECK_HEADERS.

	For example, also warn if a directory changes while we are dumping it.
	Prefer file descriptors to file names when retrieving/setting file
	attributes; this saves path-resolution time and allows us to avoid
	changing mtime/ctime on Solaris when restoring atime as root.
	Use O_DIRECTORY when opening directories, to avoid some race conditions.
	Do not reset atime if mtime has changed.  Report an error if
	we cannot reset atime.

	regex_internal.c, regex_internal.h, regexc.c; used by rpmatch.

	(start_private_header): Use MINOR_TO_CHARS, not MAJOR_TO_CHARS,
	for minor device number.
	(write_header_name, dump_hard_link, dump_file0):
	Simplify test for old GNU format.
	(start_header): Put in placeholders for uid, etc., even when
	using extended headers, for benefit of older "tar" implementations.
	Don't assume uintmax_t is wider than 32 bits.
	Output extended header for mtime if needed.
	(dump_regular_finish, dump_file0):
	Support extended time stamp resolution.

2005-06-21  Jim Meyering  <jim@meyering.net>

	Carefully crafted invalid headers can cause buffer overrun.
	Invalid header fields go undiagnosed.
	Some valid time strings are ignored.

	* src/xheader.c (sparse_numblocks_decoder): Remove unchecked use
	of `calloc'.  Use xcalloc instead.
	(decode_time, gid_decoder, size_decoder, uid_decoder):
	(sparse_size_decoder, sparse_offset_decoder, sparse_numblocks_decoder):
	Ensure that the result of calling xstrtoumax is no larger than
	the maximum value for the target type.  Upon any failure, exit with
	a diagnostic.
	(sparse_numblocks_decoder): Avoid buffer overrun/heap corruption:
	use x2nrealloc, rather than `n *= 2' and xrealloc(p, n,....
	(decode_time): Rewrite to accept time strings like
	1119018481.000000000.  Before, such strings were always ignored.

	Adjust to recent gnulib changes.
	* lib/.cvsignore: Add dup-safer.c, fd-safer.c, unistd-safer.h.
	* src/common.h (initial_umask): New var.
	* src/create.c (start_ueader): Use it, and adjust to new modechange
	API.
	(hash_link): unsigned -> size_t parameters and result.
	* src/incremen.c (hash_directory): Likewise.
	* src/names.c (hash_string_hasher): Likewise.
	* src/tar.c (parse_opt): Set it, and adjust to new modechange API.

2005-04-19  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* tests/Makefile.am: Add shortrec.at.

2005-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/buffer.c (reading_from_pipe): Remove.  All uses removed.
	(short_read): Don't warn about short reads; they're normal.
	* tests/shortrec.at: New file.
	* tests/testsuite.at: Include it.

	* bootstrap (gnulib_modules): Don't create a file modlist.tmp, as
	it is sometimes left behind as a garbage file (maybe due to the
	multiple traps?).

2005-04-14  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/list.c: Handle Solaris 'X' type flag
	* src/tar.h (SOLARIS_XHDTYPE): New define

2005-04-06  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/tar.c: Minor fixes to text messages. Proposed by Benno
	Schulenberg.
	* src/extract.c: Likewise
	(extract_file): Assign orig_file_name
	to save_name uniformly over the program. This fixes matching
	directory names at the start of an archive volume.
	* src/buffer.c (flush_write): Warn when the name of the archive
	straddling volume boundary is longer than 100 characters. Earlier
	behavior was to issue a fatal error.
	(struct zip_magic): Reverted part of changes from 2005-04-04.
	They make the maintenance too costly. Removing `unsigned'
	qualifier from `magic' member should be enough.
	* src/compare.c (diff_init): Read directory file if in listed
	incremental. This prevents spurious 'Contents differ' diagnostics.
	(diff_archive): Minor fixes to text messages
	(diff_file,diff_dumpdir,diff_multivol): Assign orig_file_name
	to save_name uniformly over the program. This fixes matching
	directory names at the start of an archive volume.
	* src/create.c: Assign orig_file_name
	to save_name uniformly over the program. This fixes matching
	directory names at the start of an archive volume.
	* src/list.c: Likewise

	* tests/multiv04.at: New file. Test splittind directory members between
	the archive volumes.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Add multiv04.at
	* tests/testsuite.at: Likewise.

2005-04-04  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* configure.ac (AC_CONFIG_AUX_DIR): Rename from config to build-aux,
	for reasons discussed in the thread beginning at
	<http://lists.gnu.org/archive/html/bug-gnulib/2005-03/msg00119.html>.
	* .cvsignore: Remove config; add build-aux.

	* src/buffer.c (struct zip_magic): Use char arrays, not pointers.
	The unsigned char * pointer ran afoul of pedantic C compilers, and
	we didn't need pointers anyway.  Put the size field before the
	data to avoid unnecessary padding.  All uses changed.
	(magic) Make it const, since it doesn't change.  All uses changed.

2005-04-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/xheader.c (decode_record): Don't dump core when given
	a corrupted extended header.  Problem reported by Jim Meyering.
	Also, check for other ways that the header might be invalid,
	e.g., missing newline at end.  Do not allow keys with nulls.
	Allow blanks before and after length, as POSIX requires.
	Do not allow leading "-" in length.  Check for length overflow.
	(xheader_decode, xheader_decode_global): Let decode_record
	check for exhaustion of record.
	(xheader_read): Null-terminate the extended record;
	decode_record relies on this.

2005-03-21  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* bootstrap (TP_URL): Change from
	<http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~gnutra/po/maint/tar/> to
	<http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/translation/maint/tar/> to avoid
	some redirection glitches.
	Use "trap - 0" rather than "trap 0" to fix a POSIX-conformance bug.
	* doc/.cvsignore: Change "tar.info" to "tar.info*".  Sort.
	* lib/.cvsignore: Add intprops.h (new gnulib file).

2005-03-04  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/list.c (print_header): Print UID/GID in case of
	empty user/group name. This could occur when dumping
	files belonging to non-existing users and when listing
	broken archives.
	Reported by Igor Lautar.

	* src/create.c: Correctly parse empty uname/gname
	* src/sparse.c (sparse_scan_file): Bugfix. offset had
	incorrect type.

	* scripts/backup.in: Use `head -n 1'. Provide missing
	argument to ${MT_STATUS}. Proposed by Jan Merka.
	* scripts/backup.sh.in: Likewise. Fixed typo in
	MT_OFFLINE assignment.
	* scripts/restore.in (restore_fs): Use root_fs

	* THANKS: Added Tim Adye. Fixed UTF.
	* src/list.c (read_header): Removed assignment to
	oldgnu_header.isextended. It was breaking append mode.

	* tests/append01.at: New test.
	* tests/Makefile.am: Added append01.at
	* tests/testsuite.at: Likewise

2005-02-06  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* gnulib.modules: New file. List of required gnulib
	modules.
	* bootstrap: Merge list of required modules from
	paxutils with that from tar proper.
	* src/tar.c: Various fixes in help and diagnostic messages.

2005-02-05  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/common.h (EXTRACT_OVER_PIPE): New macro
	* src/compare.c: Code clean up.
	* src/extract.c (extract_archive): Do not check for
	EXTRACT_OVER_PIPE, decode_options() does this.
	* src/misc.c (exec_error,fork_error,dup2_error)
	(pipe_error): Removed unneeded functions.
	* src/system.c (sys_exec_command): Use xclose, xpipe,

	(ignore_command_error_option): New globals
	(sys_exec_command,sys_wait_command): New commands
	* src/extract.c (extract_file): Handle to_command_option
	Fix error recovery: decrease `size' by `written', not
	by `count', otherwise tar misses the next header
	Do not diagnose write error if to_command_option
	is set, since the command may have exited prematurely.
	It would be better to check for sigpipe, though.
	(prepare_to_extract): Handle to_command_option
	* src/misc.c (exec_error, fork_error, dup_error)
	(pipe_error): New functions
	* src/system.c (sys_exec_command)
	(sys_wait_command): New functions
	* src/tar.c: Handle new options --to-command,
	--ignore-command-error
	* THANKS: Added Hansjoerg Lipp

2005-02-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@cs.ucla.edu>

	* src/list.c (from_header): New arg OCTAL_ONLY, normally false.
	All uses changed.  Fix typo that sometimes suppressed all "Archive
	contains obsolescent base-64 headers" warnings, not just the first
	one.
	(tar_checksum): Accept only octal checksums, since they aren't
	supposed to overflow into weird formats.

	Adjust to gnulib changes.
	* lib/.cvsignore: Add chdir-long.c, chdir-long.h, memrchr.c,
	memrchr.h, openat.c, openat.h.  Remove pathmax.h (added by
	mistake, perhaps?), sysexit.h (my typo), xstrdup.c (gnulib removed
	this file).  Sort entries.

	* m4/.cvsignore: Ignore all *.m4 files

2005-01-18  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	Rewritten handling of -T (--files-from) option. Now it
	inserts the file names immediately into argv array which allows
	for:

2004-02-21  Sergey Poznyakoff  <gray@Mirddin.farlep.net>

	* src/create.c (dump_file0): The conditional at line
	1296 prevented incremental backups on individual files
	from working, as reported by Andreas Schuldei
	<andreas@schuldei.org>.

	This is due to the condition

	  (0 < top_level || !incremental_option)

	Removing it makes incremental backups work for individual
	files as well as for directories. On the other hand, it does
	not affect other functionality, as shown by the reasoning below:

	To begin with, the two parts of this condition are mutually
	superfluous, because

	  1) when top_level < 0, incremental_option == 1
	  so the condition yields false
	  2) when top_level >= 0, incremental_option == 0
	  so the condition yields true.

	In other words, it is completely equivalent to

	      (!incremental_option)

	Now, let's consider the effect of its removal. There are two cases:

	1) when incremental_option==1
	This means incremental backup in progress. In this case dump_file
	is invoked only for directories or for files marked with 'Y' by
	get_directory_contents. The latter are those that did not meet the
	condition in incremen.c:242, which is exactly the same condition
	as this at create.c:1296. So, for these files the check
	(!incremental_option) is useless, since the rest of the
	conditional will yield false anyway. On the other hand, if
	dump_file is invoked on a directory, the conditional will yield
	false due to !S_ISDIR assertion, so these will be processed as usual.

	Thus, for this case the extra condition (!incremental_option) is
	irrelevant, and its removal won't alter the behavior of tar,
	*except* that it will enable incremental backups on individual
	files, which is the wanted effect.

	2) when incremental_option==0
	In this case the condition yields true and its removal does not
	affect the functionality.

	(decode_options): New option --show-defaults displays the
	compiled-in defaults.
	Use POSIX format if no --format option was given and
	--pax-option was specified.
	Do not allow to use --pax-option unless the archive format is
	set to POSIX (or reading subcommand is requested).

	* src/update.c (update_archive): Write global extended header if
	constructed.
	* src/xheader.c (xheader_format_name): Bugfix.
	(xheader_xhdr_name): Changed the default extended header name
	to '%d/PaxHeaders.%p/%f', as POSIX requires.
	(xheader_ghdr_name): Removed unused argument.
	(xheader_write,xheader_write_global): New function.

	Fix Debian bug 230872, originally reported by Jeff King in
	<http://bugs.debian.org/cgi-bin/bugreport.cgi?bug=230872>.

	* doc/tar.texi (posix compliance): Remove.  The whole section
	was a misunderstanding of what POSIXLY_CORRECT is supposed to
	mean.  The GNU Coding Standards says that POSIXLY_CORRECT
	is for disabling extensions that are incompatible with POSIX:
	it is not for disabling compatible extensions.  All references
	to this section removed.
	(posix): This format is created only if the posix format is
	specified; it is no longer created if gnu format is specified
	and POSIXLY_CORRECT is set.
	* src/tar.c (decode_options): Ignore POSIXLY_CORRECT.
	POSIX does not specify the behavior of tar, so we should
	not worry about POSIXLY_CORRECT here.

	Synchronize with Gettext 0.13.1, Automake 1.8, Autoconf 2.59,
	and translation website.

	* bootstrap: Don't bother skipping codeset.m4, glibc21.m4,
	intdiv0.m4, inttypes_h.m4, inttypes.m4, inttypes-pri.m4,
	isc-posix.m4, and lcmessage.m4 from gnulib.  This list of files is
	a bit obsolete anyway, now that gettext 0.13.1 is out.  Also, the
	files are replaced by autoreconf.  Also, there seems to be a bug
	in gettext/autoconf/automake if we try to omit these files after
	autoreconf has replaced them, even though the gettext manual says
	they're optional.  So give up and just include them for now, even
	though they make 'configure' longer and slower.

	Change translation URL from
	<http://www.iro.umontreal.ca/contrib/po/maint/tar/> to
	<http://www2.iro.umontreal.ca/~gnutra/po/maint/tar/> to
	accommodate translator website revamp.

	Fail if autoreconf fails.

	* m4/.cvsignore: Add intmax.m4, longdouble.m4, printf-posix.m4,
	signed.m4, size_max.m4, wchar_t.m4, wint_t.m4, xsize.m4, to
	ignore files now supplied by gettext 0.13.1.

	* NEWS, configure.ac (AM_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Version 1.13.25.

	* src/buffer.c (flush_read): Don't diagnose partial blocks before
	end of file; just ignore them silently.

	* src/list.c (read_header): Don't keep around extended name
	and link info indefinitely; keep it only for the next file.
	This fixes a bug introduced in 1.13.24, and removes the need
	for some static variables.  Set recent_long_name and
	recent_long_link to zero if there were no long links; this
	avoids a violation of ANSI C rules for pointers in delete.c.

	recent_long_name_blocks, recent_long_link_blocks): New vars.

	The latter fails because some systems (at least rs6000-ibm-aix4.3.3.0)
	have their own, conflicting declaration of strtoimax in sys/inttypes.h.

	taking an extra stat ourselves.  All callers changed.
	(set_stat): Likewise.
	(apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat): New arg 'after_symlinks'.
	If false, stop when encountering a struct whose 'after_symlinks'
	member is true.  Otherwise, go through all structures but check
	them more carefully.  All callers changed.
	(extract_archive): When extracting a deferred symlink, if its parent
	directory's status needs fixing, then mark the directory as needing
	to be fixed after symlinks.

	* NEWS, configure.ac (AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Version 1.13.20.

	The biggest change is the new --exclude semantics and options.
	The basic idea was suggested by Gerhard Poul; thanks!

	* NEWS: Describe new --exclude semantics and options, and bug fixes.
	* README: ignfail.sh fails on some NFS hosts.
	* NEWS, README, lib/xstrtol.h: Add copyright notice.

	* Makefile.am (ACLOCAL_AMFLAGS): Add -I m4.
	(M4DIR, ACINCLUDE_INPUTS, $(srcdir)/acinclude.m4):
	Remove; the automake bug has been fixed.
	* acinclude.m4: Remove.

	* configure.ac: Renamed from configure.in.
	(AC_PREREQ): Bump from 2.13 to 2.52.
	(ALL_LINGUAS): Add id, tr.  Remove ko, as po/ko.po (dated
	1997-05-30) has an encoding error.
	(jm_AC_HEADER_INTTYPES_H): Remove; now done by autoconf.
	(AC_FUNC_FNMATCH): Use AC_CONFIG_LINKS, not AC_LINK_FILES.

	* doc/fdl.texi: Update to current GNU version.

	* doc/tar.texi: Put leading '*' in direntry.
	Accommodate new gfdl sectioning.
	New option --recursion (the default) that is the inverse of
	--no-recursion.

	New options --anchored, --ignore-case, --wildcards,
	--wildcards-match-slash, and their negations (e.g., --no-anchored).
	Along with --recursion and --no-recursion, these control how exclude
	patterns are interpreted.  The default interpretation of exclude
	patterns is now --no-anchored --no-ignore-case --recursion
	--wildcards --wildcards-match-slash.

	* lib/Makefile.am (OMIT_DEPENDENCIES): Remove.

	* lib/exclude.c (bool): Declare, perhaps by including stdbool.h.

	Initial size must now be a power of two to simplify overflow checking.
	(free_exclude, fnmatch_no_wildcards): New function.

	are determined by add_exclude.  Now returns bool, not int.
	(excluded_filename, add_exclude):
	Add support for the fancy new exclusion options.
	(add_exclude, add_exclude_file): Now takes int options arg.
	Check for arithmetic overflow when computing sizes.
	(add_exclude_file): xrealloc might modify errno, so don't
	realloc until after errno might be used.

	New macros.
	(free_exclude): New decl.
	(add_exclude, add_exclude_file): Now takes int options arg.
	(excluded_filename): No longer requires options arg, as the options

	older glibcs are buggy.

	* m4/getline.m4, m4/malloc.m4: Upgrade to serial 4.

	* m4/prereq.m4: Upgrade to serial 20, but then:
	(jm_PREREQ): Add jm_PREREQ_EXCLUDE.
	(jm_PREREQ_EXCLUDE): New macro.

	Remove redundant trailing '/' at "really_dir", for all uses, not
	just before invoking mkdir.

	* src/list.c (from_header): Do not issue a diagnostic if TYPE is zero.
	However, check for error even for '-' or '+' case.

	(print_header): Try parsing uids and gids as unsigned integers first,
	and as a uid_t or gid_t only if that fails.  This adds support for
	listing positive uids and gids that are greater than UID_MAX and
	GID_MAX.

	* src/misc.c (link_error): New function.

	* src/names.c (collect_and_sort_names):

	* lib/getstr.c, lib/getstr.h, lib/hash.h, lib/hash.h, lib/prepargs.c,
	lib/prepargs.h, lib/savedir.c, lib/savedir.h: New files.
	* lib/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST, noinst_HEADERS, libtar_a_SOURCES):
	Adjust to the above changes.

	* lib/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove ../src/ansi2knr.

	* src/open3.c: Remove.

	* src/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove ansi2knr.
	(tar_SOURCES): Remove open3.c.
	(INCLUDES): Remove -I.., as automake does that.
	(OMIT_DEPENDENCIES): ../lib/fnmatch.h -> fnmatch.h.  Add localedir.h.

	The following changes are to put LOCALEDIR into localedir.h instead
	of passing it on the command line.
	(DEFS): Remove.
	(DISTCLEANFILES): New macro.
	(localedir.h): New rule.
	(rmt.o tar.o): Now depend on localedir.h.

	* tests/delete02.sh, tests/extrac04.sh: New files.

	* tests/Makefile.am (AUTOMAKE_OPTIONS): Remove ansi2knr.
	(TESTS): Add extrac04.sh, and restore delete02.sh.
	(DEFS): Remove; LOCALEDIR is now done via localedir.h.
	(INCLUDES): Remove -I.. as automake does this now.

	* src/rtapelib.c (rexec): Don't declare unless using it.
	(do_command): Simplify signal-handling code slightly.

	* src/delete.c (blocks_needed): Remove.  All uses changed to use
	blocking_factor - new_blocks.
	(acting_as_filter): New var.
	(write_record, delete_archive_members): Use acting_as_filter
	rather than archive == STDIN_FILENO to detect whether we're acting
	as a filter, as open can return STDIN_FILENO in some cases.
	(delete_archive_members): Ignore zero blocks if
	ignore_zeros_option is nonzero.  Fix bug that messed up last
	output block: write_eot can't be used here, as it gets confused
	when the input is at end of file.

	* src/compare.c (diff_archive): Do not impose an arbitrary limit on
	symbolic link contents length.  Pass directory size to
	get_directory_contents.

	* m4/decl.m4, m4/error.m4, m4/mbstate_t.m4, m4/prereq.m4,
	m4/strerror_r.m4: New files.
	* m4/signedchar.m4: Remove this file.
	* Makefile.am (ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Adjust to above changes.
	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Likewise.

	* Makefile.am (DISTCLEANFILES): Add intl/libintl.h.

	* po/da.po: New translation file.

	* src/mangle.c (extract_mangle):
	Fix diagnostic with wrong number of %s'es.

	* lib/fnmatch.c (fnmatch):
	Fix some FNM_FILE_NAME and FNM_LEADING_DIR bugs,
	e.g. fnmatch("d*/*1", "d/s/1", FNM_FILE_NAME) incorrectly yielded zero.

	* lib/full-write.c (full_write): Some buggy drivers return 0 when you
	fall off a device's end.  Detect this.

	* src/system.h (IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN): Renamed from CTYPE_DOMAIN.  All
	uses changed.
	(open): Remove macro; we no longer support EMUL_OPEN3.  Do not
	include <pathmax.h> and directory include files like <dirent.h>;
	no longer used.  Include <savedir.h> instead.
	(closedir, signed_char): remove macro; no longer used.
	(bool, false, true): Include <stdbool.h> if you have the include
	file, otherwise define.

	* src/misc.c:
	(is_dot_or_dotdot, closedir_error, closedir_warn, opendir_error,
	opendir_warn, readdir_error): Remove; no longer needed.
	(safer_rmdir): Strip leading ./ (or .// or ./// or ././ or etc.)
	before deciding whether we're trying to remove ".".
	(remove_any_file): Try unlink first if we are not root.  Use
	savedir when recursively removing directories, to avoid exhausting
	file descriptors.
	(savedir_error, savedir_warn, symlink_error): New functions.

	* src/list.c: (read_and): Do not invoke
	apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat; DO_SOMETHING is now
	responsible for that.  Do not invoke apply_delayed_set_stat; our
	caller is now responsible for that.
	(read_header): Use signed char instead of signed_char.  Prevent
	later references to current_header from mistakenly treating it as
	an old GNU header.
	(from_header): Quote invalid base-64 strings in diagnostics.
	(time_from_header): Do not warn about future timestamps in
	archive; check_time now does that.
	(print_header): Quote unknown file types.
	(skip_member): New function, replacing skip_extended_headers and
	now skipping the whole member instead of just the extended
	headers.  All callers changed.  This makes the code handle
	extended headers uniformly, and fixes some bugs.

	* src/update.c (update_archive): Use skip_member.

	* src/extract.c (we_are_root): Now global.
	(struct delayed_symlink): New type.
	(delayed_symlink_head): New var.
	(extr_init, fatal_exit): Invoke extract_finish on fatal errors,
	not apply_delayed_set_stat.
	(set_mode, set_stat): Pointer args are now const pointers.
	(check_time): New function.
	(set_stat): Warn if setting a file's timestamp to be the future.
	(make_directories): Do not save and restore errno.
	(maybe_recoverable): Set errno to ENOENT if we cannot make missing
	intermediate directories.
	(extract_archive): Invoke apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat here,
	not in caller.  Extract potentially dangerous symbolic links more
	carefully, deferring their creation until the end, and using a
	regular file placeholder in the meantime.  Do not remove trailing
	/ and /. from file names.  Do not bother checking for ".." when
	checking whether a directory loops back on itself, as loopbacks
	can occur with symlinks too.  Also, in that case, do not bother
	saving and restoring errno; just set it to EEXIST.
	(apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat): A prefix is a potential
	ancestor if it ends in slash too (as well as ending in a char just
	before slash).
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): Remove.
	(apply_delayed_symlinks, extract_finish): New functions.

	* doc/fdl.texi: New file.
	* doc/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add fdl.texi.
	($(srcdir)/tar.info): Add fdl.texi.  Invoke makeinfo with --no-split.
	* doc/tar.texi: Add Free Documentation License.  New section
	"Overwrite Old Files", and revamp that section to make it easier to
	follow.  "tar" -> "GNU tar" where appropriate.  Migrate getdate
	documentation into getdate.texi.  Fix several minor typos.  Describe
	TAR_OPTIONS.  Describe incompatibility between incremental backups and
	--atime-preserve.  Describe incompatibility between --verify and other
	options.  Mention that tar normally removes symbolic links rather than
	following them, when extracting a file of the same name.

	* THANKS: Add gpoul.  Change skip's address.

	* po/POTFILES.in: Add lib/human.c.

	* src/common.h (namelist, namelast): Remove decls.
	(we_are_root, extract_finish, skip_member, savedir_error,
	savedir_warn, symlink_error, gnu_list_name): New decls.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat, apply_nonancestor_delayed_set_stat,
	skip_extended_headers, is_dot_or_dotdot, closedir_error,
	closedir_warn, opendir_error, opendir_warn, readdir_error,
	readdir_warn): Remove decls.
	(get_directory_contents): New off_t arg.
	(addname): Now returns struct name *.

	* src/tar.h, tests/genfile.c: Fix comments.

	* src/create.c: Include hash.h.
	(gnu_list_name): Remove decl.
	(struct link): Remove "next" member.
	(linklist): Remove.
	(start_header): Say "leading `FOO'" rather than "`FOO' prefix" for
	consistency with other diagnostics.
	(deal_with_sparse): Check for I/O error when closing the file.
	(create_archive): Do not allocate an array of size PATH_MAX, as
	PATH_MAX might be (size_t) -1.  Instead, allocate an array with
	the size that's needed.
	(hash_link, compare_links): New functions.
	(dump_file): Do not exhaust open file descriptors when descending
	deeply into a directory, by using savedir rather than
	opendir/readdir.  Do not zero-fill the name buffer unnecessarily.
	Hash the set of links already created, instead of using a linked
	list.  Fix some bugs in outputting sparse files which caused the
	sparse tables to be incorrect.  When a file unexpectedly shrinks,
	output zeros rather than garbage.  Do not allocate an array of
	size PATH_MAX, as PATH_MAX might be (size_t) -1.  Instead,
	allocate an array with the size that's needed.

	* src/incremen.c: Include hash.h.
	(struct directory): Remove "next", "dir_text".  Change "name" to
	be char[1] with struct hack, not const char *.  Add "found".
	(directory_list): Remove.  Replaced by directory_table.
	(directory_table): New var.
	(nfs_string): Renamed from nfs.
	(hash_directory, compare_directories): New functions.
	(note_directory): Now returns struct directory *.  First arg is
	now const pointer.  struct stat arg is now dev_t, ino_t, nfs.
	Remove text arg.  New "found" arg, basically corresponding to the
	old text arg not being null.  All callers changed.
	(note_directory, find_directory): Use hash table rather than
	linked list.
	(get_directory_contents): New arg "device".  Use savedir to do the
	hard work.  Save the nfs-ness of stat_data, since it might change
	under us.  Use note_directory instead of find_directory to save
	some work.  When adding an "A" record, do it with
	add_to_accumulator instead of cheating with strcat.
	(read_directory_file): Use "+" flag before device to indicate
	whether it was NFS.  Fix typo in checking for strtoul error.
	(write_directory_file_entry): New function.
	(write_directory_file): Use it, and use the hash routines to
	traverse the directory table.
	(gnu_restore): Use savedir rather than opendir/readdir.

	* src/tar.c: Include localedir.h, prepargs.h.
	(long_options): Now static.
	(long_options, usage, decode_options): -j is now short for
	--bzip2, and -I is now an alias for -T.
	(decode_options, main): argv is not const pointer now.
	(decode_options): Invoke prepend_default_options to support
	TAR_OPTIONS.  In diagnostic, mention the string that was the
	invalid blocking factor, tape length, group, owner, or record
	size.  --delete is no longer incompatible with -f -, undoing
	2000-01-07 change.
	(main): Invoke extract_finish at end of extraction.

	* src/rmt.c: Include localedir.h.
	(main): Update copyright date to 2000.

	* doc/getdate.texi: New file, taken from fileutils 4.0.27, with the
	following changes: Use @sc where appropriate.  Document the ranges of
	supported times more precisely.  Add Eggert to getdate authors.
	Document old Latin 12m/12pm tradition.  Remove list of alphabetic time
	zone names, as it wasn't correct and people shouldn't be relying on it
	anyway.  Relative items also account for non-DST adjustments.  Fix
	some misspellings.

	* lib/prepargs.c, lib/prepargs.h, tests/extrac04.sh: New file.

	* tests/ignfail.sh: opendir -> savedir in diagnostics.

	* tests/preset.in: Set LANGUAGE to the empty string, for some
	brain damaged host.

2000-10-20  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/fnmatch.m4: Mention the GNU C library.

2000-10-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/fnmatch.m4: Add a couple more test cases to catch bugs in
	glibc 2.1.95.

2000-10-17  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (<limits.h>): Do not include; human.h does it if needed.
	(CHAR_BIT): Remove.

	* lib/human.h (<limits.h>): Include if HAVE_LIMITS_H.
	(CHAR_BIT): Define if not defined.

2000-09-09  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c: From fileutils: rename ISASCII to IN_CTYPE_DOMAIN.

2000-08-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Memory exhausted -> memory exhausted

	* lib/xalloc.h (xalloc_msg_memory_exhausted):
	change to array from char *.

2000-08-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4: Define mbstate_t to be int, not char, for
	compatibility with glibc 2.1.3 strftime.c.

2000-07-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_n_options):
	Don't make the initial slot vector a constant,
	since it might get modified.

	* lib/quotearg.c: Add support for more than one preallocated slot.

2000-07-30  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_n_options):
	Preallocate a slot 0 buffer, so that the caller
	can always quote one small component of a "memory exhausted" message
	in slot 0.

2000-07-23  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	Include <wchar.h> even if ! (HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX), so that
	mbstate_t is always defined.

	Do not inspect MB_LEN_MAX, since it's incorrectly defined to be 1 in
	some GCC installations, and this configuration error is likely to be
	common.

2000-07-22  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	When the system forces us to redefine mbstate_t, shadow its mbsinit
	function.  From Bruno Haible.

2000-07-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Simplify exhausted message.

	* lib/quotearg.h: Update copyright date; from Jim Meyering.

2000-07-13  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.h (enum quoting style):
	New constant clocale_quoting_style.

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	(quoting_style_args, quoting_style_vals, quotearg_buffer_restyled):
	Add support for clocale_quoting_style, undoing previous change to
	locale_quoting_style.

2000-07-10  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c:
	<wchar.h>: Include only if HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX,
	since otherwise we don't need it.
	(MB_CUR_MAX): Redefine to 1 if ! (HAVE_MBRTOWC && 1 < MB_LEN_MAX),
	since we don't do multibytes in that case.
	(quotearg_buffer_restyled): If a unibyte locale, don't bother to
	invoke multibyte primitives.

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T):
	Renamed from AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT.  All uses changed.
	Change from a two-part test, which defines both HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT
	and mbstate_t, to a single-part test that simply defines mbstate_t.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc): Do not use HAVE_WCHAR_H in the definition.
	Use defined mbstate_t, not HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT,
	to decide whether to define the BeOS workaround macro;
	this adjusts to the change to AC_MBSTATE_T.

	* m4/strerror_r.m4: New file.

2000-07-05  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c: Use double-quote to quote.

	* lib/quotearg.c (N_): New macro.
	(gettext_default): New function.
	(quotearg_buffer_restyled): Use gettext_default ("{LEFT QUOTATION MARK}",
	"\"") for left quote, and gettext_default ("{RIGHT QUOTATION MARK}", "\"")
	for right quote.

	* lib/quotearg.c (struct quoting_options):
	Simplify quote_these_too dimension.
	From Bruno Haible  <haible@clisp.cons.org>.

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT):
	Test for mbstate_t only if the test
	for an object-type mbstate_t fails.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc): Declare returned type, since BeOS doesn't.

2000-07-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4 (AC_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT): Port to autoconf 2.13.
	Add AC_CHECK_HEADERS(stdlib.h), since we use HAVE_STDLIB_H.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc):
	Assign to *pwc, and return 1 only if result is nonzero.
	(iswprint): Define to ISPRINT if we are substituting our own mbrtowc.

2000-07-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbstate_t):
	Do not define; it should be defined with AC_CHECK_TYPE.

2000-06-26  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/mbstate_t.m4: Include stdio.h before wchar.h, to work around
	a bug in glibc 2.1.3.

	* lib/xmalloc.c: Fix inaccurate comment for xrealloc.

2000-06-19  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (ISASCII): Add #undef and move definition to follow
	inclusion of wctype.h to work around solaris2.6 namespace pollution.
	(ISPRINT): Likewise.
	Reported by Tom Tromey.

2000-06-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (adjust_value): New function.
	(human_readable_inexact): Apply rounding style even when printing
	approximate values.

	* lib/human.c: Avoid shadowing warnings.
	From Jim Meyering.

2000-06-14  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/human.c (human_readable_inexact): Allow an input block size
	that is not a multiple of the output block size, and vice versa.

	* lib/getdate.y (get_date): Apply relative times after time zone
	indicator, not before.

2000-05-31  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4: Rewrite so that we don't need to run getconf,
	and thus don't need AC_CANONICAL_HOST.

	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_FLAGS, AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_SPACE_APPEND): Remove.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_TEST_INCLUDES): New macro.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE_MACRO_VALUE): Change arguments from
	CODE-TO-SET-DEFAULT to VALUE, INCLUDES, FUNCTION-BODY.  All uses
	changed.  Instead of inspecting the output of getconf, try to
	compile the test program without and with the macro definition.
	(AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Do not require AC_CANONICAL_HOST or check for
	getconf.  Instead, check for the needed flags by compiling test
	programs.

	* configure.in (AC_CANONICAL_HOST): Remove; the largefile stuff no
	longer needs it.
	* config.guess, config.sub: Remove these files, for similar reasons.

2000-05-03  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE): Define _XOPEN_SOURCE to be
	500, instead of _GNU_SOURCE to be 1, to work around glibc 2.1.3
	bug.  This avoids a clash when files like regex.c that define
	_GNU_SOURCE.

2000-05-02  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/largefile.m4 (AC_SYS_LARGEFILE):
	Define _GNU_SOURCE if this is needed to make
	ftello visible (e.g. glibc 2.1.3).  Use compile-time test, rather than
	inspecting host and OS, to decide whether to define _LARGEFILE_SOURCE.

	* lib/quotearg.c (mbrtowc, mbstat_t):
	Add definitions if !HAVE_MBSTATE_T_OBJECT.
	(<wctype.h>): Include if HAVE_WCTYPE_H.
	(iswprint): Define to 1 if we lack it

2000-04-18  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	Don't use -n32 on IRIX if the installer said
	otherwise.

2000-02-28  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (ALERT_CHAR): New macro.

	* lib/getdate.y: Handle two-digit years with leading zeros correctly.
	(textint): New typedef.
	(parser_control): Changed from struct parser_control to typedef
	(for consistency).  Member year changed from int to textint.  All
	uses changed.
	(YYSTYPE): Removed; replaced by %union with int and textint
	members.
	(tID): Removed; not used.
	(tDAY, tDAY_UNIT, tDAYZONE, tHOUR_UNIT, tID, tLOCAL_ZONE,
	tMERIDIAN, tMINUTE_UNIT, tMONTH, tMONTH_UNIT tSEC_UNIT, tSNUMBER,
	tUNUMBER, tYEAR_UNIT, tZONE, o_merid): Now of type <intval>.
	(tSNUMBER, tUNUMBER): Now of type <textintval>.
	(date, number, to_year): Use width of number in digits, not its
	value, to determine whether it's a 2-digit year, or a 2-digit
	time.
	(yylex): Store number of digits of numeric tokens.  Return '?' for
	unknown identifiers, rather than (unused) tID.

2000-01-16  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/quotearg.c (quotearg_buffer_restyled):
	Do not quote alert, backslash, formfeed,
	and vertical tab unnecessarily in shell quoting style.

2000-01-15  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* m4/c-bs-a.m4:
	Change quoting to be compatible with future autoconf versions.

2000-01-11  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* lib/exclude.c (FILESYSTEM_PREFIX_LEN, ISSLASH): Remove unused macros.

2000-01-07  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* NEWS, configure.in (AC_INIT_AUTOMAKE): Version 1.13.17.

	Fix bug with fnmatch.h dependency, as follows:

	incompatible, since we didn't have time to fix their bugs.

	* tests/Makefile.am (TESTS): Remove delete02.sh.
	* tests/ignfail.sh: Adjust to new quoting scheme again.

2000-01-06  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>

	* tests/ignfail.sh (err): Adjust to new quoting scheme.

	* tests/delete02.sh: Fix typo: need to list archive2, not archive.

	* tests/extrac03.sh: Use -P option, so that .. doesn't get diagnosed.

	* src/tar.c ("quotearg.h"): New include.
	(usage): Now has __attribute__ ((noreturn)).
	(confirm): Report errno if we can't open tty.

	(quote_copy_string): Quote only newline and backslash; the output is no
	longer meant for humans, and is locale-independent.
	(contains_dot_dot): New function.
	(remove_any_file): Don't use lstat; just rmdir the file and then use
	unlink if the rmdir fails because the file isn't a directory.
	Check for readdir and closedir errors.
	(maybe_backup_file): Report "stat" for stat errors.
	(maybe_backup_file, chdir_do):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.

	Add support for --overwrite.
	(extract_sparse_file, extract_archive):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.
	(extract_archive): By default, warn about ".." in member names, and skip them.
	Don't open files with O_NONBLOCK or O_APPEND.
	Open with O_TRUNC only if --overwrite; otherwise, use O_EXCL to avoid
	overwriting them.  Pass only rwxrwxrwx permissions to `open' and `mkdir',
	minus the current umask.  Keep track of intermediate directories made,
	to avoid looping when making x/../x when x doesn't exist; the
	earlier code solved this in a different way that didn't fit well
	into the new scheme.  Don't extract permissions onto existing
	directories unless --overwrite is given.  Do not add -wx------
	permissions to new directories permanently; just do it temporarily.
	Remove no-longer-needed hack with MSDOS and directory time stamps.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): New argument specifies which directories to
	fix statuses of.  Do not wait until the end of extraction to fix
	statuses; instead, fix a directory's status once we exit that directory.

	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.

	* src/create.c (<quotearg.h>): New include.
	(start_header): Use `member names' to refer to archive member names, not
	`archive names'.  Warn about `..' in member names.
	(finish_sparse_file, dump_file):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.
	(finish_sparse_file, dump_file):
	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.
	(dump_file): Don't use `access' to determine whether a directory is readable;
	this isn't reliable if tar is setuid.  Use `opendir' instead.
	Check for readdir and closedir failures.
	Don't dump sockets as if they were fifos; just warn and skip.

	* src/delete.c (move_archive):
	Don't report fatal error merely because sizes don't fit
	into struct mtop values; fall back on lseek instead.
	Say `Cannot' uniformly, instead of `Could not' sometimes and `Cannot' others.
	Say `reposition' instead of `re-position'.
	(delete_archive_members):
	Set archive to STDOUT_FILENO before outputting trailing buffer.

	unlink_first_option.
	(apply_delayed_set_stat): Now takes char const * param.
	(fatal_exit, contains_dot_dot, chdir_fatal, close_error,
	closedir_error, exec_fatal, mkfifo_error, mknod_error, open_error,
	open_fatal, open_warn, opendir_error, opendir_warn, read_error,
	read_fatal, readdir_error, readdir_warn, readlink_error,
	readlink_warn, seek_error, seek_warn, stat_error, stat_warn,
	truncate_error, truncate_warn, unlink_error, waitpid_error,
	write_error, write_fatal, xfork, xpipe, quote, quote_n): New decls.

	* src/buffer.c:
	(xclose, xdup2, child_open_for_compress, child_open_for_uncompress,
	archive_write_error, archive_read_error, flush_archive, close_archive,
	init_volume_number, new_volume):
	Don't assume that gettext preserves errno.

	(xdup2): Don't report errno if dup returns an unexpected nonnegative value.
	(open_archive): Reject multivolume verify attempts a bit earlier.
	Rename local variable `access', in case it's defined by system header.

	`Could not' sometimes and `Cannot' others.

	(open_archive, flush_read, flush_archive, close_archive, new_volume):
	Quote arbitrary strings in diagnostics.

	(read_error): Set archive to STDOUT_FILENO temporarily when writing
	archive buffer.

	(init_volume_number): Check for input and output errors in volno_file.

	(new_volume): Use new fatal_exit function to exit, and new xfork
	function to fork.

	* m4/Makefile.am (EXTRA_DIST): Add c-bs-a.m4.

	* Makefile.am (ACINCLUDE_INPUTS): Add $(M4DIR)/c-bs-a.m4.

	Do not set errno to EPIPE; we no longer use perror.

	* src/create.c (dump_file):
	If a parent directory said that a file should be there but it is
	absent, diagnose it as being removed in the meantime.
	Do not pass meaningless errno to ERROR when reporting that the
	file changed as we read it.
	Report that a file changed if its ctime changes; this is more
	sensitive than mtime+size, and more accurate.

	* src/incremen.c (enum children): New type.
	(struct directory): Change old char allnew member to new enum children
	children member.
	All uses changed.
	(get_directory_contents): When doing an incremental dump that does
	not cross filesystem boundaries, dump the mount points, even though
	they are in a different filesystem.  This is for convenience when
	restoring, and for consistency with non-incremental dumps.
	This requires a 3-way flag for keeping track of which children we want,
	so we use enum children rather than boolean.

	* src/open3.c (modes): Remove.
	(open3): Remove unportable assumptions about flag encodings.
	Use `stat' instead of `access' for testing file existence,
	to avoid problems with setuid programs.

	* lib/fnmatch.c, lib/fnmatch.hin: Merge changes from latest glibc.

	Allow different forms for unportable 2's complement numbers.

1999-03-01  Paul Eggert  <eggert@twinsun.com>
