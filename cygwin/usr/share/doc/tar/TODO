Suggestions for improving GNU tar.

* <45BEC0DB.8040903@unix-beratung.de>

* Incorporate fixes from major distributions, e.g., Debian GNU/Linux.

* Add support for restoring file time stamps to sub-second resolution,
  if the file system supports this.

* Add support for restoring the attributes of symbolic links, for
  OSes like FreeBSD that have the lutimes and lchmod functions.

* --append should bail out if the two archives are of different types.

* Add support for a 'pax' command that conforms to POSIX 1003.1-2001.
  This would unify paxutils with tar.

* Interoperate better with Joerg Schilling's star implementation.

* Add an option to remove files that compare successfully.

  It would be useful to be able to use '--remove-files' with '--diff',
  to remove all files that compare successfully, when verifying a backup.

* Add tests for the new functonality.

* Consider this:

  What I would like to do is:

  foo my.tar.gz | tar -xzOf - | tar -cMf - -L 650000 - | bar

  where 'foo' is a program that retrieves the archive and streams it
  to stdout and bar is a program that streams the stdin to CDR.
