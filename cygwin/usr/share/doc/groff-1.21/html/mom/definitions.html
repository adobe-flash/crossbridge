<h3 id="typesetting-terms" class="docs">Typesetting terms</h3>
<dl>
  <dt id="ascender">Ascender</dt>
  <dd>
  The portion of a letter that extends above the bowl.  For
  example, the letters a, c, and e have no ascenders.  The letters
  b, d, and h do.
  </dd>

  <dt id="baseline">Baseline</dt>
  <dd>
  The imaginary line on which the bottoms of capital letters and
  the bowls of lower case letters rest.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="ballotbox">Ballot box</dt>
  <dd>
  An unfilled square, usually
  <a href="#capheight">cap-height</a>
  in size, typically placed beside items in a checklist.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="bullet">Bullet</dt>
  <dd>
  A small, filled circle typically found beside items or points in
  a list.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="capheight">Cap-height</dt>
  <dd>
  The height of the tallest capital letter in a given
  <a href="#font">font</a>
  at the current
  <a href="#ps">point size</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="descender">Descender</dt>
  <dd>
  The portion of a letter that extends beneath the
  <a href="#baseline">baseline</a>
  (j, q, y are letters with descenders).
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="discretionaryhyphen">Discretionary hyphen</dt>
  <dd>
  A symbol inserted between two syllables of a word that indicates
  to a typesetting program the valid hyphenation points in the
  word.  Normally, if hyphenation is turned on, groff knows where
  to hyphenate words.  However, hyphenation being what it is
  (in English, at any rate), groff doesn&#8217;t always get it right.
  Discretionary hyphens make sure it does.  In the event that the
  word doesn&#8217;t need to be hyphenated at all, groff leaves them
  alone.  In groff, the discretionary hyphen is entered with
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \%  (backslash followed by a percent)
  </span>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="dropcap">Drop cap</dt>
  <dd>
  A large, usually upper-case letter that introduces the first
  paragraph of a document or section thereof.  The top of the
  drop cap usually lines up with the top of the first line of the
  paragraph, and typically &#8220;drops&#8221; several lines lower.
  Text adjacent to the drop cap is indented to the right of the
  letter until the bottom of the drop cap is reached, at which
  point text reverts to the left margin.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="em">Em/en</dt>
  <dd>
  An em is a relative measurement equal to the width of the
  letter M at a given
  <a href="#ps">point size</a>
  in a given
  <a href="#font">font</a>.
  Since most Ms are designed square, an em is usually (but
  sometimes erroneously) considered to be the same size as the
  current point size (i.e. if the point size of the type is 12,
  one em equals 12 points).  An en is equal to the width of a
  letter N (historically 2/3 of an em, although groff treats an en
  as 1/2 of an em).  Typically, ems and ens are used to measure
  indents, or to define the length of dashes (long hyphens).
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="family">Family</dt>
  <dd>
  The collective name by which a collection of
  <a href="#font">fonts</a>
  are known, e.g.  Helvetica, Times Roman, Garamond.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="figurespace">Figure space/Digit space</dt>
  <dd>
  A
  <a href="#fixedwidthspace">fixed width space</a>
  that has the width of one digit.  Used for aligning numerals in,
  say, columns or numbered lists.  In groff, the figure space is
  entered with
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \0  (backslash followed by a zero)
  </span>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="fixedwidthfont">Fixed width font</dt>
  <dd>
  A family or font in which every character occupies exactly the
  same amount of vertical space on the line.  Courier is the
  best-known, if not the most elegant, fixed-width font.
  </dd>

  <dt id="fixedwidthspace">Fixed width space</dt>
  <dd>
  Equal to
  <a href="#wordspace">word space</a>,
  but does not expand or contract when text is
  <a href="#just">justified</a>.
  In groff, fixed width space is entered with
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \&lt;space&gt; (backslash followed by hitting the spacebar)
  </span>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="font">Font</dt>
  <dd>
  The specific
  <a href="#weight">weight</a>
  and
  <a href="#shape">shape</a>
  of type within a
  <a href="#family">family</a>,
  e.g. light, medium, bold (which are weights), and roman, italic,
  condensed (which are shapes).  By default, groff knows of four
  fonts within its default set of families: R (medium roman), I
  (medium italic), B (bold roman) and BI (bold italic).
  Mom considerably extends this very basic list.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="force">Force justify</dt>
  <dd>
  Sometimes, in
  <a href="#just">justified</a>
  text, a line needs to be broken short of the right margin.
  Force justifying means telling a typesetting program (like
  groff) that you want the line broken early AND that you want the
  line&#8217;s word spacing stretched to force the line flush with the
  right margin.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="gutter">Gutter</dt>
  <dd>
  The vertical whitespace separating columns of type.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="just">Justify/justification</dt>
  <dd>
  Lines of type are justified when they&#8217;re flush at both the left
  and right margins.  Justification is the act of making both
  margins flush.  Some people use the terms "left justified" and
  "right justified" to mean type where only the left (or right)
  margins align.  I don&#8217;t.  See
  <a href="#quad">quad</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="kern">Kerning</dt>
  <dd>
  Moving pairs of letters closer together to remove excess
  whitespace between them.  In the days before phototypesetting,
  type was set from small, rectangular blocks of wood or metal,
  each block having exactly one letter.  Because the edge of
  each block determined the edge of each letter, certain letter
  combinations (TA, for example) didn&#8217;t fit together well and had
  to be mortised by hand to bring them visually closer.  Modern
  typesetting systems usually take care of kerning automatically,
  but they&#8217;re far from perfect.  Professional typesetters still
  devote a lot of time to fitting letters and punctuation together
  properly.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="kernunit">Kern Units</dt>
  <dd>
  A relative distance equal to 1/36 of the current
  <a href="#ps">point size</a>.
  Used between individual letters
  for
  <a href="#kern">kerning</a>.
  Different typesetting systems use different values (1/54 is
  popular), and sometimes call kern units by a different name.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="leading">Lead/leading</dt>
  <dd>
  The distance from the
  <a href="#baseline">baseline</a>
  of one line of type to the line of type immediately beneath
  it.  Pronounced "ledding."  Also called line spacing.  Usually
  measured in
  <a href="#picaspoints">points</a>.
  
  <p>
  <em>In case you&#8217;re interested...</em> In previous centuries,
  lines of type were separated by thin strips of&mdash;you guessed
  it&mdash;lead.  Lines of type that had no lead between them were said
  to be &#8220;set solid.&#8221; Once you began separating them with
  strips of lead, they were said to be &#8220;leaded&#8221;, and the
  spacing was expressed in terms of the number of
  <a href="#picaspoints">points</a>
  of lead.  For this reason, &#8220;leading&#8221; and &#8220;line
  spacing&#8221; aren&#8217;t, historically speaking, synonymous.
  If type was set 10 on 12, for example, the leading was 2
  points, not 12.  Nowadays, however, the two terms are used
  interchangeably to mean the distance from baseline to baseline.
  </p>

  </dd>
  
  <dt id="leader">Leaders</dt>
  <dd>
  Single characters used to fill lines, usually to their end.  So
  called because they &#8220;lead&#8221; the eye from one element
  of the page to another.  For example, in the following (brief)
  Table of Contents, the periods (dots) are leaders.
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  Foreword............... 2
  Chapter 1.............. 5
  Chapter 2.............. 38
  Chapter 3.............. 60
  </span>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="ligatures">Ligature</dt>
  <dd>
  Ligatures are letters joined together to form a single
  character.  The commonest are fi, fl, ff, ffi and ffl.  Others
  are ae and oe.  Occasionally, one sees an st ligature, but this
  is archaic and quite rare.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="picaspoints">Picas/Points</dt>
  <dd>
  There are twelve points in a pica, and six picas in an inch
  (hence 72 points to the inch).  In the same way that gem-dealers
  have always used their own system of measurement for weight
  (carats), typographers have always used their own system of
  measurement for type.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="ps">Point Size</dt>
  <dd>
  The nominal size of type, measured in
  <a href="#picaspoints">points</a>
  from the bottom of the longest
  <a href="#descender">descender</a>
  to the top of the highest
  <a href="#ascender">ascender</a>.
  In reality, type is always fractionally smaller than its point
  size.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="quad">Quad</dt>
  <dd>
  When only one margin of type is flush, lines of type are quadded
  in the direction of the flush margin.  Therefore, quad left
  means the left margin is flush, the right isn&#8217;t.  Quad right
  means the right margin is flush, the left isn&#8217;t.  Quad centre
  means neither the left nor the right margin is flush; rather,
  lines of type are quadded on both sides so that type appears
  centred on the page.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="rag">Rag</dt>
  <dd>
  Describes a margin that isn&#8217;t flush.  Rag right means the right
  margin isn&#8217;t flush.  Rag left means the left margin isn&#8217;t flush.
  The expression "flush left/rag right" is sometimes used to
  describe type that is
  <a href="#quad">quadded</a>
  left.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="shape">Shape</dt>
  <dd>
  The degree of slant and/or the width of characters.
  (Technically speaking, this is not a proper typesetting term;
  however, it may help clarify some concepts presented in these
  documents.)
  
  <p>
  Some typical shapes are:
  </p>

  <ul style="margin-top: -.5em; margin-bottom: -.5em">
      <li>&#8220;Roman&#8221;, which has no slant, and has letterforms of
          average width</li>
      <li>&#8220;Italic&#8221;, which is slanted, and has letterforms
          of average width</li>
      <li>&#8220;Condensed&#8221;, which has no slant, but has
          letterforms narrower than the average represented by Roman</li>
      <li>&#8220;Condensed Italic&#8221;, which is slanted, with letterforms narrower
          than average</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
  The term
  <a href="#font">font</a>,
  as it is used in these documents, refers to a combination of
  <a href="#weight">weight</a>
  and shape.
  </p>

  </dd>
  
  <dt id="solid">Solid/set solid</dt>
  <dd>
  When no
  <a href="#leading">lead</a>
  is added between lines of type (i.e. the
  <a href="#ps">point size</a>
  and linespacing are the same), the lines are said to be &#8220;set
  solid.&#8221;
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="trackkerning">Track kerning/Line kerning</dt>
  <dd>
  Sometimes, it&#8217;s advantageous to increase or decrease the amount
  of space between every letter in a line by an equal (usually
  small) amount, in order to fit more (or fewer) characters on the
  line.  The correct term is letter spacing, but track kerning and
  line kerning (and sometimes, just "kerning") have come to mean
  the same thing.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="unbreakablespace">Unbreakable space</dt>
  <dd>
  Equal to
  <a href="#wordspace">word space</a>,
  however words separated by an unbreakable space will always be
  kept together on the same line.  Expands and contracts like word
  space.  Useful for proper names, which one should, whenever
  possible, avoid splitting onto two lines.  In groff, unbreakable
  space is entered with
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
   \~  (backslash followed by a tilde)
  </span>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="weight">Weight</dt>
  <dd>
  The thickness of the strokes of letterforms.  Medium and Book
  have average thicknesses and are the weights used for most
  of the text in books, magazines, newspapers, etc.  Light has
  strokes slightly thinner than Medium or Book, but is still
  acceptable for most text.  Semibold, Bold, Heavy and Black all
  have strokes of increasing thickness, making them suitable for
  heads, subheads, headlines and the like.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="wordspace">Word space</dt>
  <dd>
  The amount of whitespace between words.  When text is
  <a href="#just">justified</a>,
  word space expands or contracts to make the margins flush.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="xheight">x-height</dt>
  <dd>
  The height of a lower case letter x in a given font at a given
  point size.  Generally used to mean the average height of the
  bowl of lower case letters.
  </dd>
</dl>

<h3 id="groff-terms" class="docs">Groff terms</h3>

<dl>
  <dt id="alias">Alias</dt>
  <dd>
  A
  <a href="#macros">macro</a>
  invoked by a name different from its &#8220;official&#8221;
  name.  For example, the official name of the macro to change
  <a href="#family">family</a>
  is <kbd>FAMILY</kbd>.  Its alias is <kbd>FAM</kbd>.
  Aliases may be created for any macro (via the
  <a href="goodies.html#alias"><kbd>ALIAS</kbd></a>
  macro) provided the alias uses a name not already taken by the
  mom macros or one of the groff
  <a href="#primitives">primitives</a>.
  For a complete list of words or names you must not use, see the
  <a href="reserved.html#reserved">list of reserved words</a>.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="arguments">Arguments</dt>
  <dd>
  Parameters or information needed by a
  <a href="#macros">macro</a>
  to do its job.  For example, in the macro
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  .PT_SIZE 12
  </span>
  
  <kbd>12</kbd> is the argument.  In the macro
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  .QUAD LEFT
  </span>
  
  <kbd>LEFT</kbd> is the argument.  Arguments are separated from
  macros by spaces.  Some macros require several arguments; each
  is separated by a space.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="commentlines">Comment Lines</dt>
  <dd>
  <a href="#inputline">Input lines</a>
  introduced with the comment character
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \#  (backslash followed by the pound sign)
  </span>
  
  When processing output, groff silently ignores everything on a
  line that begins with the comment character.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="controllines">Control Lines</dt>
  <dd>
  Instructions to groff that appear on a line by themselves, which
  means that &#8220;control lines&#8221; are either
  <a href="#macros">macros</a>
  or groff
  <a href="#primitives">primitives</a>.
  Control lines begin with a period or, occasionally, an apostrophe.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="filled">Filled lines/fill mode</dt>
  <dd>
  Automatic
  <a href="#just">justification</a>
  or
  <a href="#quad">quadding</a>.
  In fill mode, the ends of lines as they appear in your text
  editor are ignored.  Instead, words from adjoining
  <a href="#inputline">input lines</a>
  are added one at a time to the output line until no more words
  fit.  Then, depending whether text is to be
  <a href="#just">justified</a>
  or
  <a href="#quad">quadded</a>
  (left, right, or centre), and depending on whether automatic
  hyphenation is turned on, groff attempts to hyphenate the last
  word, or, barring that, spreads and breaks the line (when
  justification is turned on) or breaks and quads the line (when
  quadding is turned on).
  
  <p>
  Nofill mode (non-filled text) means that groff respects the ends
  of lines exactly as they appear in your text editor.
  </p>

  </dd>
  
  <dt id="inlines">Inline escapes</dt>
  <dd>
  Instructions issued to groff that appear as part of an
  <a href="#inputline">input line</a>
  (as opposed to
  <a href="#macros">macros</a>,
  which must appear on a line by themselves).  Inline escapes are
  always introduced by the backslash character.  For example,
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  A line of text with the word T\*[BU 2]oronto in it
  </span>
  
  contains the inline escape <kbd>\*[BU 2]</kbd> (which means
  &#8220;move the letter &#8216;o&#8217; 2
  <a href="#kernunit">kern units</a>
  closer to the letter &#8216;T&#8217;&#8221;).
  
  <p style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  Mom&#8217;s inline escapes always take the form
  <kbd>\*[&lt;ESCAPE&gt;]</kbd>, where <kbd>ESCAPE</kbd> is
  composed of capital letters, sometimes followed immediately by a
  digit, sometimes followed by a space and a
  <a href="#numericargument">numeric argument</a>.
  Groff&#8217;s escapes begin with the backslash
  character but typically have no star and are in lower case.  For
  example, the mom escapes to move forward 6
  points on a line are either
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \*[FP6]&nbsp;&nbsp;or&nbsp;&nbsp;\*[FWD 6p]
  </span>

  Instructions embedded in a document that determine how groff
  processes the text for output. mom&#8217;s macros

  be typed in capital letters.  Typically, macros contain complex
  commands issued to groff&mdash;behind the scenes&mdash;via

  <dt id="units">Machine units</dt>
  <dd>
  A machine unit is 1/1000 of a
  <a href="#picaspoints">point</a>
  when the groff device is ps. (&#8220;ps&#8221; means
  &#8220;PostScript&#8221;&mdash;the default device for
  which groff prepares output, and the device for which
  mom was specifically designed.)
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="numericargument">Numeric argument</dt>
  <dd>
  An
  <a href="#arguments">argument</a>
  that has the form of a digit.  Numeric arguments can be built
  out of arithmetic expressions using +, -, *, and / for plus,
  minus, times, and divided-by respectively.  If a numeric
  argument requires a
  <a href="#unitofmeasure">unit of measure</a>,
  a unit of measure must be appended to <em>every</em> digit in
  the argument.  For example:
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  .ALD 1i-1v
  </span>
  
  <div class="box-important" style="margin-right: 2.5em;">
    <p class="tip">
    <span class="important">IMPORTANT:</span> groff does not
    respect the order of operations, but rather evaluates
    arithmetic expressions from left to right.  Parentheses must
    be used to circumvent this peculiarity.  Not to worry, though.
    The likelihood of more than just the occasional plus or minus
    sign when using mom&#8217;s macros is slim.
    </p>
  </div>
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="outputline">Output line</dt>
  <dd>
  A line of text as it appears in output copy.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="primitives">Primitives</dt>
  <dd>
  The lowercase instructions, introduced with a period, that groff
  uses as its native command language, and out of which macros
  are built.  The majority of groff&#8217;s primitive requests are two
  letters long.
  </dd>
  
  <dt id="stringargument">String Argument</dt>
  <dd>
  Technically, any
  <a href="#arguments">argument</a>
  that is not numeric.  In this documentation, string argument
  means an argument that requires the user to input text.  For
  example, in the
  <a href="#macros">macro</a>
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  .TITLE "My Pulitzer Novel"
  </span>
  
  <kbd>"My Pulitzer Novel"</kbd> is a string argument.
  
  <p>
  Because string arguments must be enclosed by double-quotes, you
  can&#8217;t use double-quotes as part of the string argument.  If you
  need double-quotes to be part of a string argument, use the
  <a href="#inlines">inline escapes</a>
  <kbd>\(lq</kbd> and <kbd>\(rq</kbd> (leftquote and
  rightquote respectively) in place of the double-quote character
  (<kbd>"</kbd>).
  </p>

  </dd>
  
  <dt id="unitofmeasure">Unit of measure</dt>
  <dd>
  The single letter after a
  <a href="#numericargument">numeric argument</a>
  that tells mom what measurement scale the
  argument should use.  Common valid units are:
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  i (inches)
  p (points)
  P (Picas)
  c (centimetres)
  m (ems)
  n (ens)
  u (machine units)
  v (the current leading [line space])
  </span>

  <p style="margin-top: -1em;">
  Units of measure must come immediately after the numeric
  argument (i.e. with no space between the argument and the unit
  of measure), like this:
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  .ALD 2v
  .LL  39P
  .IL  1i
  </span>
  
  The above example advances 2 line spaces and sets the line
  length to 39 picas with a left indent of 1 inch.
  </p>
  
  <div class="box-important" style="margin-right: 2.5em;">
    <p class="tip">
    <span class="important">IMPORTANT:</span>
    Most mom macros that set the size or measure of something must
    be given a unit of measure since most of the macros do not have
    default units of measure.  There are a couple of exceptions,
    the most notable of which are <kbd>PT_SIZE</kbd> and
    <kbd class="bold">LS</kbd>.  Both use
    <a href="#picaspoints">points</a>
    as the default unit of measure, which means you don&#8217;t have to
    append &#8220;p&#8221; to their argument.
    </p>
  </div>
  
  <p>
  You can enter decimal values for any unit of measure.  Different
  units may be combined by adding them together (e.g. 1.5i+2m,
  which gives a measure of 1-1/2 inches plus 2 ems).
  </p>
  
  <div class="box-tip" style="margin-right: 2.5em;">
    <p class="tip">
    <span class="note">Note:</span>
    a pica is composed of 12 points, therefore 12.5 picas is 12
    picas and 6 points, not 12 picas and 5 points.  If you want 12
    picas and 5 points, you have to enter the measure as 12P+5p.
    </p>
  </div>

  </dd>
  
  <dt id="zerowidthcharacter">Zero-width character</dt>
  <dd>
  The
  <a href="#inlines">inline escape</a>
  that allows you to print a literal period, apostrophe and, if
  <a href="#outputline">output lines</a>
  are
  <a href="#filled">filled</a>,
  a space that falls at the beginning of an
  <a href="#inputline">input line</a>.
  It looks like this:
  
  <span class="pre" style="margin-bottom: -2em;">
  \&amp; (backslash followed by an ampersand)
  </span>
  
  Normally, groff interprets a period (or an apostrophe) at the
  beginning of an input line as meaning that what follows is a
  <a href="#controllines">control line</a>.
  In fill modes, groff treats a space at the beginning of an input
  line as meaning &#8220;start a new line and put a space at the
  beginning of it.&#8221; If you want groff to interpret periods
  and apostrophes at the beginning of input lines literally (i.e.
  print them), or spaces at the beginning of input lines as just
  garden variety word spaces, you must start the line with the
  zero-width character.
