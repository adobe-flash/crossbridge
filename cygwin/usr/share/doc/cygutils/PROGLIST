msgtool.exe / shmtool.exe / semtool.exe / semstat.exe
  These programs were taken from "Linux Programmer's
  Guide - Chapter 6" with a few changes so that they 
  build cleanly.  The original versions were written
  by (C)opyright 1994-1995, Scott Burkett.
  ** MODULE: msgtool
     A command line tool for tinkering with SysV style 
	  Message Queues
  ** MODULE: semtool
     A command line tool for tinkering with SysV style 
	  Semaphore Sets
  ** MODULE: semstat
     Another tool for tinkering with Semaphore Sets
  ** MODULE: shmtool
     A command line tool for tinkering with shared memory 
  For information on how to use these tools, call them
  with the '-?' option.  Also, see the Linux Programmer's
  Guide -- the IPC chapter is included with the cygipc 
  distribution.

  
  These tools can only be built if IPC functions are 
  available.  On cygwin, that (currently) means "only if
  the cygipc package is installed" or "if using a cygwin
  kernel newer than 1.5.5"
  (GPLv3+)
  
banner.exe
  prints a large banner to stdout.  From Joerg Schaible.
  (GPLv3+)
  
lpr.exe
  can be used to spool to a windows printer
  (GPLv3+)

mkshortcut.exe
  can be used to create "full featured" windows 
  shortcuts (as opposed to cygwin-symlinks implemented
  using .lnk files, which aren't really "full-featured")
  (GPLv3+)

readshortcut.exe
  can be used to read information from windows shortcuts (such
  as target, icon, window state, etc)
  (GPLv3+)

cygstart.exe
  A command-line tool which allows you to let Windows start a program or open
  a file or URL in its associated application. It is similar to the Windows
  command-line start command.
  (GPLv3+)

cygdrop.exe
  A command-line tool which allows you to let start a Cygwin or Windows
  program with a restricted access token. All administrative rights are dropped
  by default. The tool also provides options for finer control of groups and
  privileges.
  (GPLv3+)

ipck:
  IPC utility brought over from cygipc.
  (GPLv3+)

cygicons:
  DLL containing cygwin-related icons
  (GPLv3+)

(*) originally BSD+advert, but falls under the blanket 
    conversion to BSD-no-advert, because it was originally
	 part of the UCB BSD distro. 
    <http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license.html>:
    Note: The advertising clause in the license appearing 
    on BSD Unix files was officially rescinded by the 
    Director of the Office of Technology Licensing of the 
    University of California on July 22 1999. He states 
    that clause 3 is "hereby deleted in its entirety."

Note1: "last.exe" and "utmpdump.exe" were previously provided by
cygutils.  However, once the `sysvinit' package was added to
the cygwin distribution, they were removed.  They are now
provided by `sysvinit' -- which is where we took them from
in the first place.

Note2: "cal.exe"   "col.exe"    "colcrt.exe"  "colrm.exe" "column.exe"
       "ddate.exe" "getopt.exe" "mcookie.exe" "namei.exe" "rename.exe"
       "rev.exe" 
were previously provided by cygutils.  However, they were removed in
version 1.3.0 because the `util-linux' package was added to the
cygwin distribution, and it provides those utilities.  In fact,
it was from util-linux that the versions in cygutils were originally
derived.

Note3: "ascii.exe" was previously provided by cygutils. However, it
was removed in version 1.4.8 because the separate ascii package was
added to the cygwin distribution.

Note4: "realpath.exe" was previously provided by cygutils. It was
removed in version 1.4.8 because newer releases of coreutils (>=8.15)
now provide that utility.
