Version 2.19 --> 2.20

* xmalloc.h included a readline header for no apparent reason. The compilation
  failed if readline was not installed. The dependency on the readline header
  was removed. Submitted by Tushar Teredesai.

Version 2.18 --> 2.19

* Upgraded code from bash to version 3.2. This DOES has influence
  on how Which behaves under certain circumstances.
* Support for Cygwin: Two leading slashes are now treated as
  possibly special, because a double leading slash can have an
  implementation-defined meaning (depending on the Operating
  System), as is for example the case in Cygwin.
  See http://www.opengroup.org/onlinepubs/009695399/basedefs/xbd_chap04.html#tag_04_11
  This means that GNU which no longer collapses two leading slashes
  of a path into a single slash.
* When the environment variable HOME is not set, the home directory
  is now read from /etc/passwd or set to '/' if no home directory
  could be found (this now matches the tilde lib used in bash).
* Fixed the function declaration given in README.alias
* Added a @dircategory and @direntry to which.texinfo
* Changed the license to GPLv3.

Version 2.17 --> 2.18

* Fixes regarding cwautomacros (maintainer build system only).
* Improvement of 'make release' target (maintainer target).

Version 2.16 --> 2.17

* Add support for shells that output '{' on the same line as the
  function name in the output of 'declare -f' (ie zsh).
* Added support for Tandem OSS.
* Build system now uses cwautomacros (mostly just it's autogen.sh).

Version 2.15 --> 2.16

* This release fixes the bug, introduced in 2.15, that files for
  which the 'other' permission bits apply do NOT need to be readable.
  (The confusion came from the fact that it needs to be readable
  when it is a shell script but there is no way to find out if a
  non-readable file is a shell script or not.)
  The next release of bash will be using the same algorithm again,
  and that is the only thing that really matters.  This is also the
  algorithm that most other shells use.

Version 2.14 --> 2.15

* Upgraded build system to work with automake 1.7.2 and autoconf 2.57.
* Fixed search routine to skip executables that are not executable.
  This is NOT done by all versions of bash (which is a bug).
  The stock bash-2.0.5b thinks it is allowed to execute a file
  when it has the eXec bit set for our group or other, but that
  is not the case: when we own the file, the eXec bit of the *owner*
  must be set and the group/other bits are irrelevant.  And when
  we don't own the file, but the file is in our group, then only
  the group bit matters and not the other eXec bit.  And finally,
  when we do not own the file and the file is not in our group
  then not only the 'other' eXec bit needs to be set, but the
  file must be readable as well.  This has been reported to the
  maintainer of bash.  For the rest, the search routine has been
  copied/upgraded to that of bash version 2.0.5b.

Version 2.13 --> 2.14

* Upgraded build system to work with automake 1.5 and autoconf 2.53.
* Upgraded --read-functions functionality to work with bash 2.0.5b.

Version 2.12 --> 2.13

* Support for shell functions.  This version also fixes the
  problem that the alias for `which' wasn't inherited by subshells.
  You need to change the alias by a shell function! (The rpm does
  this automatically).
* Fixes for the .spec file (merged changes from RedHat 7.1)
  Now installs the which.info file as well.

Version 2.11 --> 2.12

* Minor man page fix (no reason to upgrade at all thus)

Version 2.10 --> 2.11

* Added a texinfo file (no reason to upgrade at all thus)
  `info' is the prefered format for documenting GNU tools.

Version 2.9 --> 2.10

* Buildsystem fixes (no reason to upgrade at all thus):
  Used the correct order of calling the automake/conf utils,
  fixed my E-mail address and added a Source: line to the rpm spec.

Version 2.8 --> 2.9

* Fixed compile problem in Solaris 5.6 using cc
* Added a `--help' option
* RPMs now add a /etc/profile.d script, automatically setting a useful alias

Version 2.7 --> 2.8

* aclocal.m4 was missing from the tar, resulting in
  a build failure if autoconf isn't installed.

Version 2.6 --> 2.7

* Support for aliases
* Configure/compile fix in the `tilde' directory.

Version 2.5 --> 2.6

* Doesn't depend on libreadline.a anymore.

Version 2.4 --> 2.5

* Fixed which-2.spec
* RPMs are now available from http://www.xs4all.nl/~carlo17/which
