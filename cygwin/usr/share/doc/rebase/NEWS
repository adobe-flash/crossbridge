4.1.0
==============================================================================
    * Add rebase/rebaseall touch file (i.e., -t option) support.

    * Add rebaseall setup (i.e., -p option) support.

    * Add .oct to the default rebaseall suffix list.

4.0.1
==============================================================================
    * Change rebaseall to call rebase instead of ./rebase.

    * Configure with --sysconfdir=/etc.

4.0.0
==============================================================================
    * rebase and peflags now support operations on 64 bit objects.

    * New rebase database functionality (see README).

    * New developer application rebase-dump for displaying database contents.

    * New platform support: x86_64-w64-mingw32, i686-pc-msys.

    * peflags now supports short options for almost all flags.
      peflags -v prints detailed information about the flags set in the
      file header.

    * rebase now supports long options including improved -h/--help
      information.

    * rebase -s/--database allows to keep a database of rebased DLLs.
      This information is used in subsequent calls with the -s/--database
      option to keep the entire list of DLLs in a good shape, address-wise.

    * rebase -i/--info prints base address and size of DLLs given on
      the command line, sorted by base address.  A trailing '*' in the
      last column is printed if a DLL collides with another adjacent DLL
      in the list.  rebase -i -s can be used to check if the DLLs in the
      database are still in a good shape.

    * On Cygwin, rebase actively avoids colliding with the Cygwin DLL
      it is running under.

    * rebaseall skips mingw directories automatically.

    * rebaseall now uses the new rebase database facility.

    * The imagehelper library has been much improved:
      - Now supports reading and rebasing 64 bit binaries.
      - New functions ReBaseImage64 and GetImageInfos64.
      - Support long paths up to 32K characters.
      - General API cleanup.

3.0.2
==============================================================================
    * Autoconfify. Silence build warnings. Add support for building (natively,
      for each platform) on mingw, msys, and cygwin. Support dash/ash usage.
      Add workaround for broken getopt_long on MSYS.

3.0.1
==============================================================================
    * Placeholder.

3.0:
==============================================================================
    * New peflags utility allows to manipulate the following
      flags in DLLs:
           peflags [OPTIONS] [-T filelist | -] file(s)...
      
          -d, --dynamicbase [BOOL]  Image base address may be
                                    relocated using address space
                                    layout randomization (ASLR)
          -t, --tsaware     [BOOL]  Image is Terminal Server aware

      as well as a number of other flags (see --help output).

      By default, cygwin DLLs have 0 for both flags. Setting -d1
      for all DLLs (except cygwin1.dll) may be useful on Windows
      Vista and above. Setting -t1 on all executables may be useful
      on Windows Terminal Server.

      Use '-v' (or any of the flag arguments with no BOOL) to
      see the current flag settings for a given DLL or list of
      DLLs.

    * New peflagsall utility. You remember your SATs, right:
      peflagsall:peflags::rebaseall:rebase

The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Exclude cyglsa64.dll from rebase list

2.4.4:
==============================================================================
    * Change rebaseall to prevent "Argument list too long" errors as
      reported in:

      http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2005-09/msg00836.html

    * Change rebase to use modern method to find the image's
      IMAGE_NT_SIGNATURE as suggested in:
    
      http://www.cygwin.com/ml/cygwin/2006-02/msg00645.html

    * Change imagehelper library so it compiles under gcc 3.4.x
      (and hopefully later) as suggested in an email from Jens Dill.

    * Change rebaseall to use a tighter regular expression when
      creating the rebase list.

2.4.3:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Changes to support Cygwin's CYGWIN=transparent_exe option.

2.4.2:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change zcat to "gzip -d -c" and egrep to "grep -E" to avoid the possibly
      of invoking a (bash) shell script.

2.4.1:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change the "only ash processes are running" check to support 9X/Me.
    * Add setting PATH to support environments that do not have Cygwin's bin
      in the Windows' system PATH.

2.4:
==============================================================================
The following are the changes to rebaseall:

    * Change to exit with rebase's exit code instead of unconditionally
      exiting with zero (Axel Naumann).
    * Convert from bash to ash script.
    * Remove obsolete Apache hack.
    * Add support for spaces in file and directory paths.
    * Add rebasing of .so files too.
    * Add suffix option (i.e., -s) to support rebasing of DLLs with
      non-standard extensions.
    * Add support to verify that only ash processes are running or exit.
