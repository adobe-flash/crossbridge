#. Translators,
#.
#. Listed here are the Neverball materials (relative to the data directory)
#. that can be localised.  Each material <mtrl> has a corresponding JPG or PNG
#. texture.  To localise a material, create a localised texture for it (copy
#. the original texture <mtrl>.<ext> to <mtrl>-<lang-code>.<ext> and modify it)
#. and translate the material name to match (from <mtrl> to
#. <mtrl>-<lang-code>).
#.
#. Author's comments on the original mtrl/words texture:
#.
#. "Courier New, 40pt, bold. The words are centered in cells of 256x64 pixels.
#. For the vertical centering, the x-height is used as the reference. Some
#. manual corrections were made; for example, the hyphen in 'Fall-out' was
#. shortened in order to increase the margin on each side of the word."
#.
#. Those on GNU+Linux having the ImageMagick program suite installed may find
#. the provided scripts/gen-words.sh shell script useful.
