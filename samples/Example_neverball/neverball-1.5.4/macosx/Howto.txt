How to compile a universal binary of Neverball/Neverputt in OSX

1) Retrieve the universal binary dependencies. 
To be sure that you have universal binary frameworks installed use the following command :

file /Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Versions/Current/SDL

which normally outputs : 

/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Versions/Current/SDL: Mach-O fat file with 2 architectures
/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Versions/Current/SDL (for architecture i386): Mach-O dynamically linked shared library i386
/Library/Frameworks/SDL.framework/Versions/Current/SDL (for architecture ppc):  Mach-O dynamically linked shared library ppc
	
If it is not the previous output, retrieve SDL.framework here : http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php (Runtime Library for MacOSX)
Open the dmg file and copy the SDL.framework in /Library/Frameworks.
Do the same for:
	- SDL_image	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_image/
	- SDL_ttf	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
	- SDL_mixer	http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_mixer/
	
Now, all neverball dependencies have been installed for universal build.
 - libintl, libpng and msgfmt tool are already included in this archive

2) Check to make sure you have the latest version of Xcode.

3) Use the Xcode project found in the macosx/xcode directory.
		
Just double click the file neverball.xcodeproj

5) In Xcode, double click on "Errors and Warnings" in the left tree to open the building view

6) Select :
	Active target -> "Sparse Disk Image" 
	Active executable -> neverball (although this doesn't matter as we are going to compile everything)
	Active build configuration -> "Deployment" (In this mode both universal binary are created)
 	
	Then click on the Build button
	
	It will take a long time.
	First mapc is created
	Second Maps are compiled
	Third locale are generated
	Then neverball is compiled
	And neverputt
	and finally a sparse (read and write) dmg file is created with all stuff without temp files
	The script is now finished.
	
	You can modify the the view of the mounted sparse image (background image, icons, ...)
	
	Then unmount it and select: 
		Active target -> "Compressed disk image"
		Active executable -> neverball
		Active build configuration -> neverball

	 Then click on the Build button
	
	 A read-only dmg file is generated
	
	 All stuff is accessible in the svn directory under:
	
		macosx/xcode/build/Deployment/
	
That's all folks!
