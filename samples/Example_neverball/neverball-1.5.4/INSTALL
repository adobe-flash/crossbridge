                            * Neverball *


* REQUIREMENTS

    SDL               http://www.libsdl.org/download-1.2.php
    SDL_ttf           http://www.libsdl.org/projects/SDL_ttf/
    PhysicsFS         http://icculus.org/physfs/
    libvorbis         http://xiph.org/vorbis/
    libpng            http://www.libpng.org/pub/png/libpng.html
    libjpeg

To build Neverball  with native language support on  systems not using
the GNU C library, an additional library may have to be installed:

    libintl           http://www.gnu.org/software/gettext/

To  build Neverball  with Nintendo  Wii Remote  support on  Linux, the
"official Linux Bluetooth protocol stack"  or BlueZ and the libwiimote
library must be installed and configured:

    BlueZ             http://www.bluez.org/
    libwiimote        http://libwiimote.sourceforge.net/


* FONTS

The Deja Vu font used by  Neverball is not suitable for the Simplified
Chinese translation.   Due to file size concerns,  an appropriate font
is  not included  with Neverball;  however, if  a font  with  the name
"ttf/wqy-zenhei.ttc"  is  found in  the  search  path, Neverball  will
attempt  to use  that  font.  The  Wen  Quan Yi  Chinese  font can  be
obtained from here:

    Wen Quan Yi       http://wenq.org/en/


* COMPILATION

Under Unix and Linux, simply run

    make

Certain features  can be enabled/disabled  at compile time  by passing
additional arguments to  Make in the form "NAME=VALUE",  where NAME is
one of those listed below and VALUE is typically 0 for disabled, 1 for
enabled.

    ENABLE_NLS=1

        Enable  native  language   support.   May  require  additional
        libraries.

    ENABLE_WII=0

        Enable Wii Remote support.   Requires additional libraries and
        system configuration.

Under Mac OS X, build using the provided Xcode project files.

For  Windows  builds,  the   MinGW  cross-compilation  environment  is
supported. (Native builds  are theoretically possible using  MinGW and
MSYS.  Although care is taken  to preserve compatibility with MSYS, no
support exists and no actual testing is done.)

By default, an uninstalled build may be executed in place.


* INSTALLATION

The game  searches for game assets  in the following three  places, in
this order.  If the game is to  be installed globally, at least one of
them must be set.

 1. The directory  specified as argument to '--data'  (or '-d') option
    on the command line.

 2. The directory given by the NEVERBALL_DATA environment variable.

 3. The directory given by the CONFIG_DATA macro defined in
    share/base_config.h (which corresponds to the DATADIR Makefile
    variable).

A normal Linux installation would probably copy the data directory to
"/usr/local/share/games/neverball/" and set DATADIR to match.


* DISTRIBUTION

The dist subdirectory contains some miscellaneous files:

  * "Desktop entry" or .desktop files.
  * Icons in PNG, SVG and ICO formats.
