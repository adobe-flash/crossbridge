		SciMark2 (C version)

This is an ANSI C version of the SciMark2 benchmark,
translated from the original Java sources.  The intent
in making this benchmark available in C is for mainly
for performance comparisons.   For more information
about SciMark, see http://math.nist.gov/scimark.

Results of this benchmark can be sent to pozo@nist.gov.

The program is split up into the main driver (scimark2.c) and
kernel routines.  A sample makefile is included; 
however, one could simply write 


> cc -o scimark2  -O *.c

and then run

> scimark2

This produces an output similar to


**                                                              **
** SciMark2 Numeric Benchmark, see http://math.nist.gov/scimark **
** for details. (Results can be submitted to pozo@nist.gov)     **
**                                                              **
Using       2.00 seconds min time per kenel.
Composite Score:           65.56
FFT             Mflops:    63.38    (N=1024)
SOR             Mflops:   124.80    (100 x 100)
MonteCarlo:     Mflops:    16.05
Sparse matmult  Mflops:    59.15    (N=1000, nz=5000)
LU              Mflops:    64.40    (M=100, N=100)
0:29.62 Elapsed, 29.620 user sec, 0.010 sys sec, 100.0% utilization.



The first SciMark number reported is the composite score, followed
by the an approximate Mflop rate for each kernel.


To run the "large" version of this benchmark (with data structures
that typically do not fit in cache) use

>scimark2 -large
