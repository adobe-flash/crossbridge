Program for the calculation of the eigenvalues
of a symetric tridiagonal matrix by the method of bisection:
--------------------------------------------------------------
1) To compile using gcc type:

gcc -o bisect_test  bisect_test.c dbisect.c allocvector.c 

--------------------------------------------------------------
2) To run the benchmark type:

time bisect_test < bisect_test.in1 > bisect_test.out
--------------------------------------------------------------
3) To check whether the results are identical to the results
computed by the original program, run

diff bisect_test.out.orig  bisect_test.out


Two possibly useful modifications to the source code can be
incorporated by setting the symbols TESTFIRST and RECIPROCAL.  Thus if
a version of the program where the test (q<0) is moved t the top of
the loop, you should compile the program using the command:

gcc -DTESTFIRST -o bisect_test  bisect_test.c dbisect.c allocvector.c 

Similarly, if a version where division is relaced by reiprocal
calculation is required, issue the command:

gcc -DRECIPROCAL -o bisect_test  bisect_test.c dbisect.c allocvector.c 

The two changes can also be applied simultaniously:

gcc -DRECIPROCAL -DTESTFIRST -o bisect_test  bisect_test.c dbisect.c 
allocvector.c
