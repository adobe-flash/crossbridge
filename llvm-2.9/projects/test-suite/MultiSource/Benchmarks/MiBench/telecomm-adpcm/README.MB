Compiling:
  To compile this package, go to subdirectory ./src and
invoke "make all." This should work on most systems with
gcc. Note that on machines other than Sun Sparcs, the 
compiler switch -mv8 should not be used.

Running the programs:
  There are two scripts in the ./bin subdirectory: one for 
adpcm encoding and the other for adpcm decoding.
