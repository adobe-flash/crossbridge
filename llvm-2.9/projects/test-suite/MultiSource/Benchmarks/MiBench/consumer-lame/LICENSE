Can I use LAME in my commercial program?  

Yes, you can, under the restrictions of the LGPL.  In particular, you
can include a compiled version of the LAME library (for example,
lame.dll) with a commercial program.  Some notable requirements of
the LGPL:

1. In your program, you cannot include any source code from LAME, with
   the exception of files whose only purpose is to describe the library
   interface (such as lame.h).  

2. Any modifications of LAME must be released under the LGPL.  
   The LAME project (www.sulaco.org/mp3) would appreciate being
   notified of any modifications.  

3. You must give prominent notice that your program is:
      A. using LAME (including version number)
      B. LAME is under the LGPL
      C. Provide a copy of the LGPL.  (the file COPYING contains the LGPL)
      D. Provide a copy of LAME source, or a pointer where the LAME
         source can be obtained (such as www.sulaco.org/mp3)
   An example of prominent notice would be an "About the LAME encoding engine"
   button in some pull down menu within the executable of your program.  

4. If you determine that distribution of LAME requires a patent license,
   you must obtain such license.


***IMPORTANT NOTE***

The decoding functions provided in LAME use the mpglib decoding 
engine which is under the GPL.  They may not be used by any
program not released under the GPL unless you obtain such 
permission from the MPG123 project.  (www.mpg123.de).

LAME has built in support to read raw pcm and some wav and aiff files.
More robust file I/O can be handled by compiling in LIBSNDFILE,
but LIBSNDFILE is also under the GPL and my not be used by other
programs not under the GPL.
