Directory lout/font - font metrics files

This directory contains Adobe Systems font metrics (formerly .AFM)
files for all the fonts mentioned in file lout/include/fontdefs.  These
files are the source of Lout's information about the height and width
of all characters.  The files are exactly as distributed publicly by
Adobe Systems except that erroneous ligature information has been
removed from the four Courier font files.

In addition, for every Adobe Systems font file, (call it FF) there is
a companion file FF+ containing supplementary character definitions and
composite character definitions sufficient to support Latin2 without any
need to obtain Latin2 fonts.  These files follow a format established
by Version 3.21 of Lout, and were supplied by Jaroslav Serdula.

Lout is informed of the existence of these files by means of a database
of @FontDef symbols.  Two such are supplied with Lout, in directory
$(LOUTLIB)/data:  fontdefs.ld and latin2.ld.

All file names were previously reduced to a maximum of 8 characters,
for portability to the DOS operating system.  Now some of the FF+
files have nine characters again.  Let me know if this is a problem.
