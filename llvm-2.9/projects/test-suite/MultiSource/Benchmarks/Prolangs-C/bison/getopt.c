/* This version of `getopt' appears to the caller like standard Unix `getopt'
   but it behaves differently for the user, since it allows the user
   to intersperse the options with the other arguments.

   As `getopt' works, it permutes the elements of `argv' so that,
   when it is done, all the options precede everything else.  Thus
   all application programs are extended to handle flexible argument order.

   Setting the environment variable _POSIX_OPTION_ORDER disables permutation.
   Then the behavior is completely standard.

   GNU application programs can use a third alternative mode in which
   they can distinguish the relative order of options and other arguments.  */

   UNSPECIFIED means the caller did not specify anything;
   the default is then REQUIRE_ORDER if the environment variable
   _OPTIONS_FIRST is defined, PERMUTE otherwise.

   REQUIRE_ORDER means don't recognize them as options.
   Stop option processing when the first non-option is seen.
   This is what Unix does.

   PERMUTE is the default.  We permute the contents of `argv' as we scan,
   so that eventually all the options are at the end.  This allows options
   to be given in any order, even with programs that were not written to
   expect this.

   RETURN_IN_ORDER is an option available to programs that were written
   to expect options and other ARGV-elements in any order and that care about
   the ordering of the two.  We describe each non-option ARGV-element
   as if it were the argument of an option with character code zero.
   Using `-' as the first character of the list of option characters
   requests this mode of operation.

   The special argument `--' forces an end of option-scanning regardless
   of the value of `ordering'.  In the case of RETURN_IN_ORDER, only
   `--' can cause `getopt' to return EOF with `optind' != ARGC.  */

/* Scan elements of ARGV (whose length is ARGC) for option characters
   given in OPTSTRING.

   If an element of ARGV starts with '-', and is not exactly "-" or "--",
   then it is an option element.  The characters of this element
   (aside from the initial '-') are option characters.  If `getopt'
   is called repeatedly, it returns successively each of theoption characters
   from each of the option elements.

   If `getopt' finds another option character, it returns that character,
   updating `optind' and `nextchar' so that the next call to `getopt' can
   resume the scan with the following option character or ARGV-element.

   If there are no more option characters, `getopt' returns `EOF'.
   Then `optind' is the index in ARGV of the first ARGV-element
   that is not an option.  (The ARGV-elements have been permuted
   so that those that are not options now come last.)

   OPTSTRING is a string containing the legitimate option characters.
   A colon in OPTSTRING means that the previous character is an option
   that wants an argument.  The argument is taken from the rest of the
   current ARGV-element, or from the following ARGV-element,
   and returned in `optarg'.

   If an option character is seen that is not listed in OPTSTRING,
   return '?' after printing an error message.  If you set `opterr' to
   zero, the error message is suppressed but we still return '?'.

   If a char in OPTSTRING is followed by a colon, that means it wants an arg,
   so the following text in the same ARGV-element, or the text of the following
   ARGV-element, is returned in `optarg.  Two colons mean an option that
   wants an optional arg; if there is text in the current ARGV-element,
   it is returned in `optarg'.

   If OPTSTRING starts with `-', it requests a different method of handling the
   non-option ARGV-elements.  See the comments about RETURN_IN_ORDER, above.
