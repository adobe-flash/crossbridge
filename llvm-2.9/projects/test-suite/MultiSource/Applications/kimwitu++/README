 =  The Term Processor Kimwitu++
 =
 =--------------


Kimwitu++ is a system that supports the construction of programs that use
trees or terms as their main data structure.
For the Kimwitu++ web site (including newest version) have a look at
its homepage on http://site.informatik.hu-berlin.de/kimwitu++. 
Kimwitu++ is derived from Kimwitu 4.4, see http://purl.oclc.org/net/kimwitu.



How is this distribution structured?

  Sources:
	src/*
	src/Gen.boot/*

    The Term Processor was made using itself.
    The src directory contains the `real' *.k (Kimwitu++ input) sources.
    The src/Gen.boot directory contains the *.{h,cc} kc++-generated files
    that you need to bootstrap it.
    A src/Gen.* directory, where * is your target architecture, will be
    created while kc++ is being made. It will contain (links to) the
    kc-generated files used for boot-strapping, the compiled .o files
    and the linked binary executable kc++.

  Manual:
	man/man/kc++.1

    Tells you all you need to know to invoke kc++ (Kimwitu++).

  Documentation:
	doc/*

    The documentation is not yet avaiable. You can use the documentation
    for Kimwitu instead, using a short kc->kc++ transition guide.


How do I install Kimwitu?

  Please refer to INSTALL.


Which architectures are supported?

  Kimwitu++ just reads and writes text files, in principle it should run
  on any architecture you can think of.
  Development is done mainly on Solaris and GNU/Linux, these will be supported
  best. Probably also Windows NT.


Do I need a running Kimwitu++ to install Kimwitu++?

  No, you don't. src directory contains everything needed to bootstrap
  Kimwitu++.


Why do you bother me with all this non-sense about bootstrapping and all?

  If you ever need to apply a patch, you will need to know how to change
  Kimwitu++, and you will need the `real' *.k sources of Kimwitu++, not the
  generated *.{h,cc} stuff in src.


How do I make changes in Kimwitu++?

  You don't want to. You ask us to change Kimwitu++ if you find anything that
  needs to be changed.

  But, if you need to change anything in the sources of Kimwitu++, you should
  make your change in the src directory, *not* in the Gen.* directory, because
  the contents of that directory will be overwritten during the making of the
  new Kimwitu++.
  Note that in this case you will *need* a running Kimwitu++ to build the new
  one. After making your changes, execute `make' or `make s1' in the src
  directory. If everything is ok, you will find a new binary src/Gen.*/kc++_s1.


Who should I contact if I find anything that needs to be changed?
