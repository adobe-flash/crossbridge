Copyright Release for<br>
Contributions To SQLite
</h1>

<p>
SQLite is software that implements an embeddable SQL database engine.
SQLite is available for free download from http://www.sqlite.org/.
The principal author and maintainer of SQLite has disclaimed all
copyright interest in his contributions to SQLite
and thus released his contributions into the public domain.
In order to keep the SQLite software unencumbered by copyright
claims, the principal author asks others who may from time to
time contribute changes and enhancements to likewise disclaim
their own individual copyright interest.
</p>

<p>
Because the SQLite software found at http://www.sqlite.org/ is in the
public domain, anyone is free to download the SQLite software
from that website, make changes to the software, use, distribute,
or sell the modified software, under either the original name or
under some new name, without any need to obtain permission, pay
royalties, acknowledge the original source of the software, or
in any other way compensate, identify, or notify the original authors.  
Nobody is in any way compelled to contribute their SQLite changes and 
enhancements back to the SQLite website.  This document concerns
only changes and enhancements to SQLite that are intentionally and
deliberately contributed back to the SQLite website.  
</p>

<p>
For the purposes of this document, "SQLite software" shall mean any
computer source code, documentation, makefiles, test scripts, or
other information that is published on the SQLite website, 
http://www.sqlite.org/.  Precompiled binaries are excluded from
the definition of "SQLite software" in this document because the
process of compiling the software may introduce information from
outside sources which is not properly a part of SQLite.
</p>

<p>
The header comments on the SQLite source files exhort the reader to
share freely and to never take more than one gives.
In the spirit of that exhortation I make the following declarations:
</p>

<ol>
<li><p>
I dedicate to the public domain 
any and all copyright interest in the SQLite software that
was publicly available on the SQLite website (http://www.sqlite.org/) prior
to the date of the signature below and any changes or enhancements to
the SQLite software 
that I may cause to be published on that website in the future.
I make this dedication for the benefit of the public at large and
to the detriment of my heirs and successors.  I intend this
dedication to be an overt act of relinquishment in perpetuity of
all present and future rights to the SQLite software under copyright
law.
</p></li>

<li><p>
To the best of my knowledge and belief, the changes and enhancements that
I have contributed to SQLite are either originally written by me
or are derived from prior works which I have verified are also
in the public domain and are not subject to claims of copyright
by other parties.
</p></li>

<li><p>
To the best of my knowledge and belief, no individual, business, organization,
government, or other entity has any copyright interest
in the SQLite software as it existed on the
SQLite website as of the date on the signature line below.
</p></li>

<li><p>
I agree never to publish any additional information
to the SQLite website (by CVS, email, scp, FTP, or any other means) unless
that information is an original work of authorship by me or is derived from 
prior published versions of SQLite.
I agree never to copy and paste code into the SQLite code base from
other sources.
I agree never to publish on the SQLite website any information that
would violate a law or breach a contract.
</p></li>
