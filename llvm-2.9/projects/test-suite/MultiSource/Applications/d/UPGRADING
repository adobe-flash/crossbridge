from 1.1 to 1.2

- new_D_Parser now requires sizeof_D_ParseNode_User as an
  argument because setting this value incorrectly can result in
  subtle and confusing bugs.

- the parser now defaults to NOT doing longest match
  disambiguation during scanning.  If you want this behavior
  either specify -l to make_dparser or use ${declare longest_match ... }.
