This is the D scannerless GLR parser.  It uses to Tomita algorithm,
and incorporates BNF production syntax, regular expression terminals,
and a state-specific symbol table.

It can be compiled to work with or without the Boehm Garbage Collector.
To compile with GC, uncomment the line D_USE_GC=1 in the Makefile.

The result is natural grammars and powerful parsing.

To test: 'gmake test'	       (only available with source code package)

To install, 'gmake install'    (binary or source code packages)

For python support, '(cd python; gmake install)'
