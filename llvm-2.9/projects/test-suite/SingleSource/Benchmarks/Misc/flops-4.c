/*
   Flops.c is a 'c' program which attempts to estimate your systems
   floating-point 'MFLOPS' rating for the FADD, FSUB, FMUL, and FDIV
   operations based on specific 'instruction mixes' (discussed below).
   The program provides an estimate of PEAK MFLOPS performance by making
   maximal use of register variables with minimal interaction with main
   memory. The execution loops are all small so that they will fit in
   any cache. Flops.c can be used along with Linpack and the Livermore
   kernels (which exersize memory much more extensively) to gain further
   insight into the limits of system performance. The flops.c execution
   modules also include various percent weightings of FDIV's (from 0% to
   25% FDIV's) so that the range of performance can be obtained when
   using FDIV's. FDIV's, being computationally more intensive than
   FADD's or FMUL's, can impact performance considerably on some systems.
   
   Flops.c consists of 8 independent modules (routines) which, except for
   module 2, conduct numerical integration of various functions. Module
   2, estimates the value of pi based upon the Maclaurin series expansion
   of atan(1). MFLOPS ratings are provided for each module, but the
   programs overall results are summerized by the MFLOPS(1), MFLOPS(2),
   MFLOPS(3), and MFLOPS(4) outputs.

   The MFLOPS(1) result is identical to the result provided by all
   previous versions of flops.c. It is based only upon the results from
   modules 2 and 3. Two problems surfaced in using MFLOPS(1). First, it
   was difficult to completely 'vectorize' the result due to the 
   recurrence of the 's' variable in module 2. This problem is addressed
   in the MFLOPS(2) result which does not use module 2, but maintains
   nearly the same weighting of FDIV's (9.2%) as in MFLOPS(1) (9.6%).
   The second problem with MFLOPS(1) centers around the percentage of
   FDIV's (9.6%) which was viewed as too high for an important class of
   problems. This concern is addressed in the MFLOPS(3) result where NO
   FDIV's are conducted at all. 
   
   The number of floating-point instructions per iteration (loop) is
   given below for each module executed:

   MODULE   FADD   FSUB   FMUL   FDIV   TOTAL  Comment
