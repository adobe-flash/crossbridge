Ready to begin John Walker's floating point accuracy
and performance benchmark.  1000000 iterations will be made.


Measured run time in seconds should be divided by 1000
to normalise for reporting results.  For archival results,
adjust iteration count so the benchmark runs about five minutes.


No errors in results.
exit 0
