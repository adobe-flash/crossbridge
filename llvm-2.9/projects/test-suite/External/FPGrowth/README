In yesterday's compiler seminar, I found that ------ --- and -------- ---- have
this data mining program that could be useful for the paper. It is very compute
intensive and creates one large tree and then repeatedly creates a small tree,
uses it for a search, and then throws it away. That latter phase takes 96% of
the total run time. The code is in C++.
