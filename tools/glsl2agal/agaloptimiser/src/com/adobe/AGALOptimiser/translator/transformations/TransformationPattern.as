// patterns relate one tree of instructions/values with a new tree of instructions/values.
// 
// Basically, it consists of two sequences of patterns.  On the source side, is tree of values/instructions
// stemming from a particular result calculation.  The last pattern in the list is the final destination
// from which the pattern matching is actually performed when instructions are inspected in the tree.  
// For example, the instruction stream containing....
//
//     rcp B.w, A.s         
//     rcp C.w, B.s            
//
// might match a pattern containing
//
//     rcp ft1, ft0.xyzz
//     rcp ft2.xyz, ft1
//
// the target pattern indicates how to alter the stream.  For the above optimization, the target might be 
// 
//     mov C.w, A.s
//
// The final instruction can be replaced at pattern substitution since we will only apply this on
// registers which are written once (and in some sense in SSA-ish form at least locally at the point of 
// a specific write).  As an aside, these peephole optimizations take place before register allocation.
//
// The instruction stream would become...
//
//     rcp ft1, ft0.xyzz         <-- unless this intermediate calculation was used independently, it is dead now and will be cleaned up
//     mov ft2.xyz, ft0.xyzz
