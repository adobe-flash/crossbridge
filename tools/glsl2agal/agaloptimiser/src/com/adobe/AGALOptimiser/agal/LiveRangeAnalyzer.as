// The LiveRangeAnalyzer calculates the closure of DefinitionLine definition site to use site
// mapping for a particular definition site.

// We use a worklist reduction strategy to construct the live ranges from the definition
// lines.  Take a worklist of definition lines.  Until that worklist is empty, we do the following:
//
// 1. Remove a definition line from the worklist and seed a live range with it
// 2. Place all the use sites of the definition line on a list of use sites to trace 
//    and create a list of visited uses that is initially empty
// 3. Until that list is exhausted, do the following:
//     a. Look for definition lines still on the defintion line worklist. For any that
//        define the same virtual register and which share a register that is either on 
//        the list of visited use sites or the use sites to trace list, do the following:
//        i.    Add the definition line to the live range under construction
//        ii.   All the use sites on the definition line which are not in the visited or
//              to trace lists are added to the to trace list
//        iii.  Remove the definition line from the worklist.  It has been consumed.

// While step 3.a.ii adds to the worklist, it is followed by a removal of the 
// definition line whch gave rise to all those use sites, so results in an overall
// reduction in the work remaining.
