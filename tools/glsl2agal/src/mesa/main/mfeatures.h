/**
 * A feature can be anything.  But most of them share certain characteristics.
 *
 * When a feature defines vtxfmt entries, they can be initialized and
 * installed by
 *   _MESA_INIT_<FEATURE>_VTXFMT
 *   _mesa_install_<feature>_vtxfmt
 *
 * When a feature defines dispatch entries, they are initialized by
 *   _mesa_init_<feature>_dispatch
 *
 * When a feature has states, they are initialized and freed by
 *   _mesa_init_<feature>
 *   _mesa_free_<feature>_data
 *
 * Except for states, the others compile to no-op when a feature is disabled.
 *
 * The GLAPIENTRYs and helper functions defined by a feature should also
 * compile to no-op when it is disabled.  But to save typings and to catch
 * bugs, some of them may be unavailable, or compile to ASSERT_NO_FEATURE()
 * when the feature is disabled.
 *
 * A feature following the conventions may be used without knowing if it is
 * enabled or not.
