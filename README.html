        <p>The Windows version of CrossBridge was compiled to run within the <a href="http://www.cygwin.com/">Cygwin</a> environment. Cygwin is a Linux-like environment for Windows making it possible to port software running on POSIX systems (such as Linux, BSD, and Unix systems) to Windows. Cygwin is required to use CrossBridge on Windows. CrossBridge bundles a version of Cygwin that you can access by launching the <b>run.bat</b> file. Advanced users can <a href="#separate_cygwin">use a separate Cygwin installation</a> if desired. </p>
        <ol>
          <li>Extract the contents of the ZIP file onto your hard drive. This can be extracted to anywhere on your hard drive, but this readme will assume it is located at C:\crossbridge\</li>

          <li>Download a debugger version of the <a href="http://www.adobe.com/support/flashplayer/downloads.html">Flash Player</a> (only needed if you want to use GDB to debug your code)</li>
          <li>Double click the run.bat file</li>

        <h1>Compiling Hello World</h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>Let's try a really simple example to see how CrossBridge works. Put the following code into a file called <b>hello.c</b></p>
<pre>
#include &lt;stdio.h&gt;
int main()
{
    printf("Hello World!\n");
}</pre>

        <p>And compile it like this:</p>

<pre>
Mac> ~/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin/gcc hello.c -o hello
Win> /cygdrive/c/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin/gcc.exe hello.c -o hello.exe
</pre>

        <p>The compiler may produce warnings about dropped arguments; these can safely be
        ignored. Running the resulting binary will print the string "Hello World!" to
        your console. By default the gcc and g++ compilers in the CrossBridge toolchain will
        produce <i>projector</i> binaries. These are native executables that contain your
        application compiled to ActionScript bytecode and a captive copy of the
        ActionScript Virtual Machine (the virtual machine used in the Flash Runtime).
        Executing this projector binary will run your program.</p>

        <p>To target the Flash player we will need to tell gcc/g++ to produce a SWF file
        instead of a projector binary. This can be done as follows:</p>

<pre>
Mac&gt; ~/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin/gcc hello.c -emit-swf -o hello.swf
Win&gt; /cygdrive/c/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin/gcc.exe hello.c -emit-swf -o hello.swf
</pre>

        <p>If you load the resulting SWF into the standalone Flash player you should see
        "Hello World" on screen.</p>
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <div class="page-header">
        <h1>Compiling a Larger Project</h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>If you have a project with standard *nix-style makefiles and you want to use
        them as is, you can add the <b>sdk/usr/bin</b> folder to the head of your path like
        this:</p>

<pre>
Mac> export PATH=~/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin:$PATH
Win> export PATH=/cygdrive/c/crossbridge/sdk/usr/bin:$PATH
</pre>

        <p>This path contains replacements for the standard gcc/make toolchain which will
        do the CrossBridge equivalent code transformations.</p>
        <p>Note: Calling this command from a terminal will only update the PATH for the lifetime of that terminal window. To have this automatically set every time you launch a new terminal window consider adding the command to a .profile file.</p>
        <p>Another way of setting the path is to pass it as a parameter to make. See the make file in the Example_BulletPhysicsLibrary example to see how this is done.</p>

        <h1>Supported Flash players</h1>
      </div>
      <div>
        <p>CrossBridge generated SWFs are supported by Flash player 11.0 and AIR 3.0 and higher. SWCs generated by CrossBridge are supported by Flex Builder 4.6 and Flex SDK 4.6 or higher. Running CrossBridge generated SWFs in Flash player 10.x is not guaranteed to work and Adobe does not provide any support for that use-case.</p>

        <p>Support for concurrency is only available in Flash 11.5 and higher when targeting SWF version 18. Use of other player APIs within inline-asm statements or via the Flash++ interop mechanism might also require a specific version of the Flash player. Performing runtime checks for available APIs will allow you to produce content that supports older Flash player versions with reduced functionality whilst being able to use the latest APIs when running in a recent version of the Flash player.</p>

        <p>For a complete list of what APIs were exposed in each version of Flash <a href="http://www.adobe.com/devnet/articles/flashplayer-air-feature-list.html">visit the Flash Player feature list</a> on the Adobe Developer Connection website.</p>
