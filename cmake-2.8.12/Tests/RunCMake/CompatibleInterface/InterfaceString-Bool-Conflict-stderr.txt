CMake Error in CMakeLists.txt:
  Property "SOMETHING" appears in both the COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_BOOL and the
  COMPATIBLE_INTERFACE_STRING property in the dependencies of target "user".
  This is not allowed.  A property may only require compatibility in a
  boolean interpretation or a string interpretation, but not both.
