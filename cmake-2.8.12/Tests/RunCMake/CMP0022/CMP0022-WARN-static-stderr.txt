CMake Warning \(dev\) in CMakeLists.txt:
  Policy CMP0022 is not set: INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES defines the link
  interface.  Run "cmake --help-policy CMP0022" for policy details.  Use the
  cmake_policy command to set the policy and suppress this warning.

  Static library target "bar" has a INTERFACE_LINK_LIBRARIES property.  This
  should be preferred as the source of the link interface for this library.
  Ignoring the property and using the link implementation as the link
  interface instead.
This warning is for project developers.  Use -Wno-dev to suppress it.$
